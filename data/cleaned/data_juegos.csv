84630,Svoyi Koziri,0,"Russian card game of attacking and getting rid of all cards. Originally a game for two, three or four players, it's mostly known today in an adapted version for two players brought into England by the Mathematics professor A.S. Besikovitch, and later included in David Parlett's Oxford Guide to Card Games. This version is played with exposed cards and symmetrical hands, giving it a strong strategic flavour.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the (Besikovitch) game each player chooses two sets without overlapping with the other player, typically in a 32-card deck, out of which one is their own trump. Cards are dealt for the first player, who keeps the cards of their both sets; the second player gets exactly the same cards in the other sets and both their hands are filled up with the rest of the cards. As an example: a player who's chosen spades and clubs with spades as trumps keeps the cards in both sets and gives all their red cards together with the undealt cards to the other player, who then selects the analog cards to the first player's in the red sets with hearts as trumps, gives the rest of the red cards back to the first player and finally keeps all the remaining black cards. Both hands are symmetrical, and play can start.&#10;&#10;From now on each turn a player lays a card in a pile between both players; before the next player can play out a card of their choice they must throw one that is superior in value to the top card in the pile or a trump. If the player can't or doesn't want to do so they must take the whole pile and forfeit the turn. So, each player throws two cards in a row: one following the previous card, and one to be followed by the opponent. The first player to get rid of all cards in their hand is the winner.&#10;&#10;",2,4,0,0,6.40625,0.0,8

The playing surface or pitch slopes down from the middle to the two ends where the players stand.  In the center of the pitch is a small indentation.

Retaining the spirit of its predecessor board game Ingenious, the games in Ingenious Challenges challenge players to score as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also forcing them to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well. Four scoreboards with colored pegs and tracks for each color are used in each game, while the dice, cards and single-symbol tiles are used separately in their particular games.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Card Challenge (published separately as Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel), a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. On a turn, he plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Dice Challenge (Einfach Genial: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel), players roll dice up to three times, then score as many points for each symbol on the rolled dice as there are symbols on the dice in front of the other players. Players record these points on their scoring boards, with the barriers causing hiccups on the way, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins.&#10;&#10;&bull; In the Tile Challenge (Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert!), all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) are shuffled face down, then three are placed face up in a shared pool. On a turn, a player reveals a tile. If the tile doesn't match one in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can collect all tiles revealed this turn and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn. If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool.&#10;&#10;Incorporates:&#10;&#10;    Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel&#10;    Einfach Genial: Das W&#195;&#188;rfelspiel&#10;    Simply Ingenious &#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,45,5.85214,5.56334,478

240906,The Battles of Rhode Island & Newport,2020,"The Battle of Rhode Island is volume 9 in GMT&rsquo;s Battles of the American Revolution series by designer Mark S. Miklos.  The map board depicts the northern half of the island including the fortified American positions around Butt's Hill. There are 64 America, British and Hessian combat units and leaders giving the game a counter density comparable to Saratoga in the series. Although the tactical situation is somewhat straightforward; Americans retreating and British pursuing primarily up two main roads, the nuanced play and game texture is like that found in all the games of the BoAR series.&#10;&#10;To ensure replay-ability, each player has a unique deck of 26 Opportunity Cards that either enhance his side or diminish the enemy. Cards are drawn at-start and occasionally throughout play as governed by the turn track. There are also mechanisms for card draw tied to accumulated casualties or the possession of terrain objectives. Players may also spend Momentum to purchase additional cards.&#10;&#10;The cards themselves may provide DRMs, adjustments to Army Morale, leader replacements, tactics advantages, step losses or step recovery, and additional units introduced into play among other outcomes. There is also the possibility of the game being extended one game turn into ""night"" wherein the British launch a surprise night attack. There are only a handful of Exclusive Rules to provide chrome including a squadron of British warships which may conduct off-shore bombardment. Players familiar with the core game system will be off and running in no time.&#10;&#10;As a bonus, volume 9 will include a second scenario; The Battle of Newport.  This hypothetical scenario features a second map board depicting the southern half of the island, the city of Newport and the British defensive works that surrounded it as well as the American siege lines. The French army is presumed to have stayed on the island to cooperate in a direct assault upon the town. It will make for a fascinating ""what-if"" study of the first attempt at cooperation in the war by Franco-American forces.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,7.90698,5.58366,86

Each strand connects any two of eight positions spaced equally around the perimeter of the square, with no two strands sharing edge positions.   The images on the two faces of each tile are mirrors of each other.  In addition to the 144 unique tiles there are 6 single stranded tiles that each appear twice, forming a 150 tile set.  Tiles have a colored background that indicates the number of strand crossings contained on the tile:&#10;Blue - no crosses - 50 tiles, 44 unique&#10;Green - one crossing - 40 unique tiles&#10;Yellow - two crossings - 30 unique tiles&#10;Orange - three crossings - 10 unique tiles&#10;Red - four crossings - 6 unique tiles&#10;Purple - one each of five, six, seven or eight crossings&#10;&#10;OBJECT OF GAME:&#10;The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.&#10;&#10;HOW TO SCORE POINTS:&#10;(1) Each player scores points whenever they arrange one or more tiles, alone or in conjunction with other tiles already played, such that some of the strands on the tiles meet up to form a closed loop. Points scored are equal to the number of times the loop crosses itself or any other strand.&#10;(2) Bonus points are awarded when tiles are placed in such a way as to form a ring of tiles enclosing an empty space.  Bonus points scored are equal to the number of free strands pointing into the empty space, but only if it is an even number.&#10;&#10;HOW TO PLAY:&#10;1. Each player draws twelve tiles at random from the box.&#10;2. Players attempt to arrange their tiles to form a closed loop. The first to succeed places his loop in the center of the table, counts his score, and then draws enough tiles from the box to return his pile to twelve.&#10;3. Play continues to the left until some player reaches an agreed upon value or until the last tile in the game has been drawn.&#10;&#10;RULES OF PLAY:&#10;1. Adjacent tiles must always be placed edge-to-edge and corner to corner, and strands along touching edges must always line up - no dead ends or jogs are allowed.&#10;2. If you cannot build a loop you must forfeit your turn.&#10;3. You may build more than one loop on a single turn, but you cannot place any tile that is not part of a closed loop.&#10;4. If you forfeit your turn you may set aside one or more tiles from your pile and draw new tiles to replace them, returning the others to the box.&#10;5. You may, before placing tiles, swap any tile in your pile with any other tile on the board as long as the swap does not break any closed loop or strand.&#10;&#10;",2,12,30,30,7.0,0.0,1

8945,Stadium Checkers,1952,"The 1952 game Stadium Checkers was the most complex and the liveliest version of this gravity-based, logic-puzzle race game. A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.&#10;&#10;A player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.&#10;&#10;According to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.&#10;&#10;This game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.&#10;&#10;Variants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,5.5588,5.50522,169

It consists of a baseball field printed on the bottom of the box with a metal spinner in the middle, a rules sheet, and an envelope with nine blue and nine red cardboard disks.&#10;&#10;There is not a lot of strategy in this early game - each team uses the spinner on its turn to bat. Most of the results are either outs or hits (spaces for single, double, triple and home run), but there also are spaces for strikes, balls and base on balls. It is therefore possible but unlikely to get three strikes or four balls. There is one space for a foul ball, and any spinner stopping on a line is considered a foul as well.&#10;&#10;The one strategic option open to the batting team is whether to have base runners try to steal. In this event, the stealing team spins again, but uses an outer ring where the results are divided between ""out"", ""safe"" or ""sacrifice"" (where the runner advances but the current batter is out). An out result always picks off the lead runner.&#10;&#10;* * see corrections in Community Wiki below&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,0.0,0.0,0

10383,Risk: Godstorm,2004,"In Risk Godstorm the players are priests looking to lead their race (Greek, Celtic, Babylonian, Norse, and Egyptian) to dominate the ancient world and the Underworld as well. To do this they will need to marshall their forces, dominate continents, acquire relics of power and call their Gods to earth.&#10;&#10;Risk Godstorm uses the basic combat elements of classic Risk but alters many other elements. The game is played on an ancient map of the world that focuses on Europe and Northern Africa. Atlantis is also present and highly desirable however a chaotic event can see the fabled city sink into oblivion, taking all the forces present there with it. At its core the players are trying to control territories and controlling entire continents earns the players bonus units to deploy and further their cause.&#10;&#10;As in the play of Risk 2210 A.D., Risk Godstorm is played over 5 rounds (called Epochs here). At the end of that time frame the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled.  Also like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play. Here they are called Plague Lands. One of the key differences to classic Risk is that the Underworld can be invaded and defeated units can also be sent to the Underworld to fight again, with some proving themselves worthy enough to return to the Earth.&#10;&#10;Risk Godstorm also allows players to play Classic Risk using the Godstorm board for an alternate experience.&#10;&#10;",2,5,120,120,6.27552,5.84995,2684

Three times the Germans drove them back, until finally on 18 May 1944 a troop of Polish Lancers raised their red-and-white pennant over the ruins.

Each player starts in his/her personal corner of the working board. The players take turns rolling two dice and moving around the board accordingly. A player landing on a personal working field gains experience. A player landing on another players working field triggers a bank payment to that payment, depending on that player's experience for that particular field.

Only in the territories leading to Madrid and to the south were the Nationalists thwarted, but at an increasingly bloody cost. The Soviet Union sent massive amounts of weaponry and equipment, while volunteers poured in from throughout Europe, the US and Canada to support the Republican cause. The leadership of the Republican military decided to launch a counter-attack against the Nationalists that were deployed directly west of Madrid. The plan was to attack from the Republican held northern salient to take the crucial town of Brunete, and the main highway leading to Madrid to its south. Success here would compel the fascists to withdraw from the territory closest to the national capitol, and give the Republicans a badly needed victory. One of the largest battles of the war to-date was about to unfold.&#10;&#10;Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

This was a clash between numbers of weapon-systems. The English had mostly bill and bow, though their light cavalry (the moss troopers) used a small crossbow called a latch. The Scots had changed over to the pike and were well supplied with cannon. I have assumed the Highland formations were not pike armed but used the more traditional sword and axe.           &#10;           &#10;The battle was one of the last with a medieval format of a small number of large &ldquo;battles&rdquo; &ndash; six a side at Flodden. These units manoeuvre on a map of the area around Flodden hill from which the Scots descended. The counters representing the bands of men are stored on Arrays which are displays that resemble a plan view of the unit counter. You will typically put the best bands at the front, and will also consider whether to put bows in the front line or in the rear.           &#10;           &#10;The combat system models the degradation of combat effectiveness as losses and morale reductions take a toll. However, just because the less experienced men at the back of the unit are unhappy does not mean that the unit will break. The key individual captains and &ldquo;Big Men&rdquo; of the front-line units must be defeated. When a unit snaps the entire unit will rout.           &#10;           &#10;The order system models the difficulty of controlling large bodies without radios.

At the start of the game the pieces are arranged in cross formations on specific board spaces, with each cross containing one piece of each color and the center of each cross being a different color.&#10;&#10;A move consists of a player moving a piece orthogonally any number of empty spaces. There are five special spaces which when landed on let the player make another move with the same piece or a piece of the same color, counting it as part of the same move.&#10;&#10;The object is to get the five pieces of each color in a connected group. The game can be played as a solitaire puzzle or by multiple players; the designer suggests playing with two by trading off setting up boards for the opponent (the goal being to solve the opponent's puzzle in fewer moves than they solve yours), or any number by each trying to solve the same puzzle in the fewest moves.&#10;&#10;",1,4,0,0,8.0,0.0,1
53953,Thunderstone,2009,"For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;",1,5,60,60,6.9096,6.63806,10609

Then it is a matter of setting up the other colorful bits such as the starting stalls, the finishing post and of course the five lovely plastic horses complete with weighted swinging jockeys.&#10;&#10;Players then present their stall cards to get their starting places and have an opportunity to bet on who they think will hit the finish line first.&#10;&#10;From here it is a matter of turning a crank at the starting line which causes the track to vibrate under the horses propelling them slowly forward, until a winner emerges.&#10;&#10;As far as I can determine this seems entirely random (although the weighted jockeys seem to behave differently each time). Though the game would be a great beer and pretzels action affair or for those loving horse racing.

The first player to unite all of his pieces on the board into a single group wins.&#10;&#10;To start, white places one piece anywhere on the 8x8 square board. Players then alternate placing pieces on the board, with the first piece being adjacent to the opponent's most recently placed piece and the second piece being adjacent to no pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally.&#10;&#10;Once a player can't place a second piece, the placement phase ends and the next player starts the movement phase. On a turn, a player moves one piece akin to a queen in chess, with movement ending after passing through any number of empty spaces or by landing on an opponent's piece and capturing it. If this move increases the total number of groups on the board &mdash; with a group being a single stone or a series of straight- or diagonally-connected like-colored stones &mdash; then the move is illegal. Gameplay continues until one player unites all of his pieces into a single group; if he simultaneously creates single groups for both players, then the game is a draw.&#10;&#10;Instead of using a chess board, Inertia can be played on a hexhex board with pieces moving like hex rooks.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,7.0,0.0,4

186404,Vault,2015,"INTRODUCTION&#10;&#10;Vault is an abstract game in which each player tries to reach the opponent&rsquo;s back rank. Vault is named after pole vaulting, which is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole as an aid to jump over a bar. Vault is a derivative of Onager, by the same designer and uses a variation of its jumping mechanism (also present in Billabong, for example) that allows multiple directions to be used. It&rsquo;s like vector movement but without acceleration. Unlike Onager, Vault only works well on a square grid, as jumping directions are difficult to visualize in a hexagonal grid.&#10;&#10;MATERIAL&#10;&#10;- A square grid with an even number of cells (recommended 10x10). Preferably checkered* for clarity, but this is not mandatory.&#10;- As many white and black pawns as the number of cells per side.&#10;&#10;SETUP&#10;&#10;Each player has an allocated colour (Black or White). Fill your nearest row with pawns of your colour (one per cell).&#10; HOW TO PLAY&#10;&#10;White starts. Players alternate turns during the game until the victory condition is reached. On your turn, either walk or jump with one of your pawns.&#10;&#10;Walk&#10;&#10;Move one of your pieces to an adjacent empty space as a King in Chess.&#10;&#10;Jump&#10;&#10;In order to jump, choose 2 friendly pieces. One of the pieces then jumps over the other piece in the direction defined by both pawns, landing on a space beyond that is at a distance equal to the distance between the two friendly pieces before the jump was made (like a mirror). Notice that jumping is not restricted to orthogonal or diagonal directions.&#10;&#10;The landing space must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece, which is then captured and removed from the game. A piece cannot land on a friendly piece. Pieces cannot land outside the board.&#10;&#10;Notice that the spaces between the jumping pawn and the landing space don&rsquo;t need to be empty. Also, captures can only be made by jumping.&#10;&#10;GAME END&#10;&#10;If at the start of your turn you have at least one piece on your opponent's back rank then you have won.&#10;&#10;If the above condition is not reached and you can&rsquo;t make a legal movement at the start of your turn, you lose. This rarely happens. Players may agree on a draw at any moment during the game.&#10;&#10;NOTES FROM THE DESIGNER&#10;&#10;This is intended to be the simplest game that uses this jumping mechanism. I&rsquo;ve decided not to use Onager&rsquo;s stacking mechanism (in order to make is simpler for turn based online play and also playable with non-stacking pieces) or the multiple jump (as it would be almost impossible to think ahead).&#10;&#10;As a variant, you can use the stacking mechanism of Onager.&#10;&#10;(*) On a checkered board, the jumping piece always lands in a space of the same colour as the starting one.&#10;&#10;",2,2,15,30,7.01351,5.51822,37

Even so, with the US likely still in another post-Vietnam-funk-type of &ldquo;neo-isolationism,&rdquo; the possibility for a blitz-style conventional Iranian victory across the region &ndash; aimed at fully establishing and certifying Tehran as the unchallengeable hegemon of the Gulf region &ndash; moves to the fore. The game&rsquo;s scenario can also be taken as a model of a possible Iranian reply to a US and/or Israeli precision aerial campaign targeted against their nuclear development facilities.&#10;&#10;More particularly, though, the game examines what may well prove to be the precipitating event for such a war: a declaration of full independence by Iraqi Kurdistan. Such a move would almost certainly be quickly followed by similar declarations from the Turkish and Iranian portions of Kurdistan. In turn, no new regime in Irbil could then possible do anything other than admit those two additional territories into a &ldquo;Greater Kurdistan.&rdquo; That would then just as quickly mean Iran and Turkey would effectively find themselves at least becoming cobelligerents (if not outright allies), with a shared interest in destroying the new country as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;This wargame examines the strategic possibilities and parameters inherent in the opening Iranian offensive of such a war. There are no rules for the use of nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction. The situation is on such a hair trigger in relation to that aspect of things, if one such weapon were to go off, many more detonations would be certain to follow. The idea for Tehran (and Ankara) would be to gain a victory without resorting to &ldquo;game changing&rdquo; WMD.&#10;&#10;Further, the entirely playable on its own, Isis War can also be played as an expansion and update of my earlier design, Oil War: Iran Strikes.

Investigators may go crazy or die out right, however, they have a chance to fight back. The Investigators use Moxie to push back the waves of the occult and supernatural.&#10;&#10;Building your personal library by researching in the Miskatonic University makes you stronger and is your only hope against the Elders.

24843,Graenaland,2006,"In 982, a Viking jarl called Erik the Red sailed from the western coast of Iceland and discovered a new land. He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.&#10;&#10;Take the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.&#10;&#10;At first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.&#10;&#10;The main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.&#10;&#10;A tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.&#10;&#10;If you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? &#10;The game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead. As the others take it in to account when searching for partners for their deals.&#10;&#10;",3,5,90,90,6.69156,5.78302,683

Thus, at its heart, Ice Flow is a resource management game coupled with a traveling salesman type problem where the ground (or ice) is constantly moving.&#10;&#10;Each player has three explorers and rucksack card (to store a limited amount of rope and fish in).  The board consists of an array of hexagonal spaces with ice floes (hexagonal plastic tiles) that are introduced at the top and can be moved down the board by players with rates dependent on where they are on the board.  On their turn players must first move, rotate or introduce a new ice floe, then they can move one of their explorer as far as they can (or want) before collecting an item from the tile they finished on.  When moving, explorers are limited by the obstacles they must overcome and the tools they have available.  For example, the ice floes have smooth sides and rough side: the rough sides depict ""pack ice"" which is hard to cross, and costs a rope.  Similarly, explorers can swim up to one space, but that costs a fish as swimming through arctic waters is energy sapping.  Polar bears are also a hazard that must be avoided or lured away with fish; beware they can be lured away from one player straight into the path of another!&#10;&#10;The winner is the first player to negotiate all the hazards and arrive in Siberia with his three explorers intact.&#10;&#10;Not to be confused with:  IceFloe&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,75,6.38059,5.84646,1430

In turn, they acquire Royal and Ecclesiastical (church) titles which give their families influence to elect the next Pope and King. Players strengthen their positions by negotiating marriage alliances between their families, setting the stage for love, treachery, and deception!&#10;&#10;FIEF is a classic game and this edition includes a new board (FIEF France: Gameboard)!&#10;&#10;The game board represents the Kingdom of France in the Middle Ages. Villages have square outlines that are connected by roads that allow Lord and Troop movement. The villages are grouped into eight colored background areas that represent individual Fiefs, which are domains given to Lords to preside over. Fiefs have different colored backgrounds. Each village also belongs to one of five church Bishoprics; each Bishopric is outlined with a heavy border line and is numbered between 1-5 along the edge of the board inside a Bishop's Mitre. Bishoprics include several different Fiefs' villages.&#10;&#10;Each player controls up to four family members, comprised of male and female nobles. These family members will rise in power by gaining Royal and Ecclesiastic Titles.&#10;&#10;In FIEF France edition, a player may attempt to gain control of all the villages in a Fief to gain the Royal Title of Baron, Earl, or Duke. For each Fief a player controls, they gain 1 VP. These Titled Lords may now take part in the election for the next King. They may even be a candidate to become King, thus bringing 1 VP and more power to the family! Other members of your family may follow the calling of the Church to gain the Ecclesiastical Titles of Bishop and then Cardinal. These titles allow you to Tithe Bishoprics, taking the Church's (i.e. ""your"") fair share of income from other Fief Lords! The highest goal your clerical family member can attain is to be elected Pope, bringing 1 VP and special privileges to your family!&#10;&#10;You win the game as soon as you have 3 VPs. This is easier said than done and you may need to form alliances with other players through diplomacy and marriage to attain your goal. When one of your family members marries a noble of another family, the two of you become allied. You now win the game together with 4 VPs and cannot win alone, unless your marriage is annulled by the Pope or your spouse is ""mysteriously"" murdered or dies by some other foul means!&#10;&#10;In addition to being wary of your fellow players, you draw event cards that can quickly change your destiny.

These include ""The Plague"", ""Heavy Rain"", ""Famine"", and ""Peasant Uprising""!&#10;&#10;Income can be increased by players imposing church tithes on their opponent's villages or taxing their own Fiefs. Players may purchase new Fief titles, improve their village incomes with mills, and fortify their cities.&#10;&#10;Players will also need to protect their land and castles. Men-at-Arms and Knights can be purchased, as well as Archers and Bombards. If you feel that other players are not running their Fiefs as well as you can, you may try to invade their territories! But you must risk one of your family members to lead the troops into possible battle, where they might be killed or taken prisoner. If two opposing armies are in the same village square, a Battle may be initiated. The players assess the size and strength of their armies, which determine the number of Battle Dice each may roll.

233018,"Red Star/White Eagle: The Russo-Polish War, 1920 – Designer Signature Edition",2018,"Red Star/White Eagle: The Russo-Polish War, 1920, Designer Signature Edition, marks the return of a true wargaming classic by David Williams, remastered and updated with this all-new edition. Celebrated by many as one of the finest and often sought-after game titles ever produced by Game Designers&rsquo; Workshop (GDW, 1979) on a fascinating, almost forgotten conflict that would determine the course of European history for the next twenty years or more.&#10;&#10;To the West, the First World War was &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;. To the submerged nationalities of Eastern Europe, this war removed the obstacles to their political aspirations&ndash; Tsarist Russia collapsed in 1917; Germany and Austria-Hungary were defeated in 1918. The disintegration of these empires sparked a chaotic period of struggles in Eastern Europe, as proponents of the old order, nationalists, and revolutionary socialists fought for supremacy. The conflict between the Poles and the Bolsheviks was the most important campaign in determining the borders of Eastern Europe.&#10;&#10;Red Star/White Eagle is an operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the 1920 conflict over the border areas of Eastern Europe. Game play is not for the faint of heart with open maneuvering creating a fast and fluid situation as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. Nearly any defensive line can be bypassed in the wide-open expanse of West Russia, forcing players to probe for vulnerabilities and seize the initiative. An exhaustive Order of Battle helps capture the key historically facets of the campaign including supply, cavalry charges, armored trains, loss of command, inter-front cooperation, rail nets, railroad reserve, flotillas and marines, border garrisons, numerous specialized units, and more.&#10;&#10;This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the GDW 1979 release that honors the original game design. All aspects of the game are being enhanced, based on years of player experience and feedback. One example is adding initial set-up and reinforcement entry codes to all units to ease set-up and play. Play time can vary with three scenarios provided and the Campaign Game. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, the Campaign game is credited as allowing for up to three players (with two playing the Russian side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic design by David Williams. All components are upgraded to include a larger playing surface () and to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;    two maps&#10;    two countersheets (344 5/8&rdquo; counters)&#10;    five player aid cards &#10;    one small deployment map&#10;    one rule book (28 pages)&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the publisher and back of the box)&#10;&#10;",1,3,180,480,7.85294,5.56467,68

On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.&#10;&#10;Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game.  First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers.  So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero.  Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.&#10;&#10;Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,45,6.9459,6.09939,1555
73251,Leipzig: Napoleon Encircled,2010,"From the Decision Games' website:&#10;&#10;Napoleon was, by 1813, the victim of his own success. His Grande Arm&eacute;e had ransacked most of Europe, but then the Prussians, Austrians, Russians, Swedes and others converged their armies, collectively known as the Sixth Coalition, around Leipzig in an attempt to annihilate Napoleon once and for all. The coalition commanders knew they had to approach cautiously. Napoleon had previously defeated each of those nations' armies, and had demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome unfavorable odds before. At Leipzig, however, Napoleon was heavily outnumbered, and the princes of Europe realized there might never be a better chance to vanquish him and finally end the Napoleonic Wars.&#10;&#10;Leipzig utilizes an all-new Musket & Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the era while also simulating the unique aspectsof 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.&#10;&#10;In Leipzig a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that time. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.&#10;&#10;",1,2,60,60,6.125,5.51112,44
92219,The Little Big Game of Shmoozel,2005,"Players are dealt a hand of ten cards, each of which is a letter of the alphabet worth a number of points (there are also a few wild cards).  Players try to empty their hands by spelling five-letter (or longer) words using their letter cards.  They can also add letters to their own previously played words (although they cannot rearrange the letters):  for example, adding S, ED, or ING to WRECK.&#10;&#10;Each turn players draw two cards and must discard one.  Players may also take letters from the discard pile, but these must be used immediately -- and all discards prior to the one they take must be taken into their hand.&#10;&#10;A round ends when a player goes out by spelling a word plus having one card to discard.  Points from exposed words are totaled; points from letters held in the hand are subtracted unless they can be dumped into words (which are worth nothing).&#10;&#10;A complete game consists of four rounds. Highest point total is the winner.  Note: spelling SHMOOZE is worth 50 points and spelling SHMOOZELED is worth 250 points -- a bit of a balance wrecker.&#10;&#10;",2,6,60,60,0.0,0.0,0

The player then starts to draw one animal that has features of both animals rolled, say, a zebeera or a pifrog. When any of the other players think they know what is being drawn, they grab the grunting plastic zebra-schwein and give their answer.

When played competitively, the rules suggest dividing an arbitrary number of participants (like a class of pupils) into two teams, potentially with a moderator (like a teacher) to read out clues from the text cards. The teams then try to collect pairs of cards either by identifying the species on a given picture card, gaining an additional point if they don't need any clues to do so, or by selecting the right picture card based on the clues from the corresponding text card.&#10;&#10;In addition to Skogen, the series includes the entries Insj&ouml;n (The Lake), &Auml;ngen (The Meadow), Havet (The Sea), Fj&auml;llet (The Fell), and Staden (The City).&#10;&#10;",2,99,0,0,2.0,0.0,1

It also retains the mathematical elegance of Hex, which has nice implications such as the impossibility of draws, and the existence of seemingly very different scoring rules which are provably equivalent.

In No Hearts, also called Reds, the aim is to avoid winning Hearts or ""reds"". A red may not be led to the first trick unless forehand only has reds. Players may not discard a red to the first trick unless they only have reds. In the succeeding tricks, reds may be discarded if a player has no card of the led suit. Each red card taken in tricks scores 1 point.&#10;Obers. The aim is in Obers to avoid capturing Obers. Each Ober is worth 2 points. An Ober may not be led to the first trick, nor may an Ober be laid to it unless the player only has an Ober in the led suit (i.e. the Ober is a singleton). In the remaining tricks, Obers may be discarded at any stage if a player cannot follow suit.&#10;No Tricks. In No Tricks, also just Tricks, the aim is to avoid taking any tricks. Each trick is worth a point.&#10;Lorum. This contract is, like the last deal in most compendium games, a Domino-type contract. Forehand leads any card to the table. The next player in turn must play either a card of the same rank in another suit or lay off the next highest card of the same suit next to the first card. An Ace follows a Seven. If a player is unable to play a card, he misses a turn. Players may not miss a turn if they are able to play. Every turn missed costs one point. As soon as the first player goes out by laying off his last card, the remaining players score a point for each card still held in the hand. Alternatively the deal can continue until each player in succession goes out. In this variation, the second player to go out scores 1 point per card, the third player, 2 points per card and the last player, 3 points per card.&#10;&#10;In addition, one or more (typically two or four) of the following contracts are usually inserted between the third deal above (No Tricks) and the final deal (Lorum).[6]&#10;&#10;First and Last Trick. In First and Last (Erster und letzter Stich) the aim is to avoid taking the first and last tricks; each of which counts as 4 (variation: 5) points. Short variant: Only two cards are dealt to each player, the stock being given to the next dealer. The first player to lead plays one of his two cards. The winner of the trick then leads to the 'last' trick. Suit must be followed if possible. Each trick scores 4 (or 5) points.&#10;Fifth Trick. In Fifth Trick (F&uuml;nfter Stich) players must avoid taking the fifth trick, after which the deal is ended. It scores 8 points.&#10;Seventh Trick. As Fifth Trick except players avoid taking the seventh trick.&#10;Red King. The aim in Red King, also called Red King-less, is to avoid capturing the 'red king' (the King of Hearts). It scores: 16 points when captured in the first trick, 8 points in the second to seventh tricks, 32 points in the last trick and 64 points if announced before playing the last trick.&#10;Hairy Ape. As Red King, but players hold their cards facing their opponents; then play cards at random. If two or more are of the same suit, the highest wins otherwise each card 'takes' itself. The player who take the red King scores 8 points.&#10;Train (Vonat). Using the Ace-Ten scoring system, card points are added cumulatively as they are played. The first to exceed 25 wins 1 point, 50 wins 2 points, 75 wins 3 points and 100 wins 4 points.&#10;Quart(el) or Kvart. In Quartel, to the first card played, the 3 next higher cards of the same suit must be added in sequence by whoever has them until and unless no-one has the next higher card. Players do not need to play in clockwise order. The trick is won by the player who placed the last card in the sequence and he then leads to the next trick. If an eligible player has a highest card of its suit at that stage of the game in his hand (usually an Ace, but also a Seven if the Eight of the same suit has already been played), he can put it away as ""high"". The game ends when the first player goes out by discarding his last card. This may not necessarily be the current player. The cards remaining in the other players' hands score 1 point each.&#10;All Bad (Mindenrossz). A combination of several contracts e.g. No Tricks, No Hearts, No Obers and No Red King.&#10;&#10;",2,4,0,0,6.54545,0.0,11

It is also fully compatible with all of the other Dominations expansions!&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each Age, each player will draw a Province card, then take the corresponding Province tile which will be added to their hand. This tile must be placed on the board during the Age during your Growth phase, at the same time as a regular domino. Each player will hence be playing six dominoes during the Age instead of the usual five. These dominoes will have unique illustrations and characteristics : some will have resources, some will have other effects, much like the Monument tiles.&#10;&#10;Once your Province tile has been placed, you can Conquer it. To do so, you&rsquo;re going to need a whole new resource : Conquest! Conquest is represented by a deck of small Conquest cards that can only be gained one way - using one of the expansion&rsquo;s new Mastery cards: Conscription. Conscription is a unique Mastery card in that it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any Domain: at has a value of 3 that can be purchased using any kind of resource. It is then used as a converter &ndash; changing any Knowledge type into Conquest cards.&#10;&#10;When Conquest cards are purchased, they are drawn from the Conquest deck, which is placed face down on the table. Each card has a value of 1 to 5 Conquest Points, and as they&rsquo;re drawn randomly, you never know what you&rsquo;re going to get! Additionally, some of these cards have special powers and bonuses!&#10;&#10;To conquer a Province, you must pay the corresponding number of Conquest points as stated on the tile&rsquo;s Province card. However, these Provinces won&rsquo;t allow themselves to be conquered easily. Each Province card also has a &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; value. This refers to the deck of Rebellion cards, which - similarly to the Conquest cards - are drawn randomly, have a value of 1 to 5, and some of them have special powers that can be good or bad. You must draw the number of Rebellion cards specified, then add their value to that Province's Conquest value to determine its full cost. If you have enough Conquest points, then you conquer the Province &ndash; placing a City token on it and gaining the bonus stated on its card. As with the classic dominos, just because you placed a Province tile, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s yours - once placed, any player can conquer it!&#10;&#10;However, although the tiles MUST be placed during the Age, you don&rsquo;t have to conquer them. Each Province has an End of Age effect, which is triggered if it has not been conquered. These effects can be good or bad &ndash; from allowing you to gain additional resources, to unleashing hordes of barbarian invaders to destroy neighbouring Cities!&#10;&#10;These combinations of different effects bring a fascinating new strategic facet to Dominations. Will you conquer as many Provinces as you can to reap the benefits, or will you simply place the tiles next to your opponents&rsquo; Cities, forcing them to react to avoid negative End of Age effects?&#10;&#10;Provinces brings a slightly more aggressive stance to your games of Dominations, in that your actions can potentially damage your adversaries : Provinces is the first expansion where your nation can actually lose ground : Cities can be destroyed, resources lost.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,120,7.385,5.54041,50

The remainder of the map layout is determined at discretion of the players though most of the land spaces should be flat land with a few clumps of forests and mountains and a few solitary hills, villages, and swamps. &#10;One road connects the city to a village or two and then goes off the map. A few Islands dot the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Terrain types will affect the movement of the different unit types.&#10;&#10;There are 11 different unit types: Infantry, Engineers, Cavalry, Artillery, War Machine, Flying Machine, Fortification, Small Warship, Large Warship, Transport and Mine Field.  Each unit type has a move rating, hits score and range, and may have a special capability.&#10;&#10;The players start with a pre-defined army comprising a mix of the various units.  The attacker (the Fivizzano) starts with his units in the bottom half of the Southern quadrants. In addition the Fivizzano gets one roll against the leader table and 4 rolls against the invention table &ndash; these give advantages / enhancements that last for the duration of the battle. The defender (the Piombino) starts with units scattered in the Northern quadrants, one roll against the leader table and 6 against the invention table.&#10;&#10;Players share a Tactics deck comprising cards that mostly give short duration benefits.  These cards can be used, when appropriate, to enhance your own actions or negate those of your opponent&#10;&#10;Players take turns with each turn comprising 4 Phases:&#10;&#10;Draw Phase&#10;&#10;     Draw 2 Tactics cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;Move Phase&#10;&#10;     Each of your Units may be moved once up to a number of spaces equal to its move rating. &#10;&#10;&#10;Attack Phase&#10;&#10;      Each of your units may make 1 attack vs. a target within its range. When attacking roll 1D10. On a roll of 7 or higher the attack is successful and the target loses 1 hit. A unit with zero hits is destroyed. &#10;&#10;&#10;End Phase &#10;&#10;     Max Hand size is 5 cards. Discard excess cards. &#10;&#10;&#10;The Fivizzano win if they occupy 4 of the spaces of the city. &#10;The Piombinos win if they destroy 20 or more units.&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,5.0,0.0,1

13883,Jenseits von Theben,2004,"This entry is for the original Jenseits von Theben; for the new printing by Queen, go to Thebes.&#10;&#10;Jenseits von Theben is a game of competitive archeology.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Macedonians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Periodically, there are expositions at major European cities, and the archaeologist who shows up on time with the best collection of artifacts (plus a minor die roll) wins the purse.  The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and presents the biggest collection to the European exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.&#10;&#10;The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact cards.  The game uses a novel mechanic to keep track of this -- there is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board, and each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time.  Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in ""time"".  So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the ""time"" to catch up.&#10;&#10;In addition, the artifact cards in each civilization are a hidden number.  The deck for each civilization contains twelve treasures of varying point values and two knowledge cards, with another sixteen cards of dirt.  At the beginning of the game, seven cards are removed from each deck without the players seeing them.  Through the course of the game, when a player excavates at a site, he or she keeps the artifacts that are revealed from a site, but the dirt is shuffled back into the remaining cards.  Both the imperfect information element as well as the recycled dirt make for a random chance element that is overcome somewhat by digging at a site where a player has much knowledge -- more knowledge means that more cards will be revealed in a shorter period of time, and a greater chance of revealing treasures that may yet remain after another player has already recovered some treasures from that site.&#10;&#10;The original run of Jenseits von Theben was hand-produced by Prinz Spiele in a first edition of 100, and a second edition of 300.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Thebes&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,4,75,75,7.12673,5.82571,554

One card, for example, allows a player to:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Collect rice (up to four bundles depending on the number of samurai applied to the action),&#10;    Collect $5 (per samurai),&#10;    Collect wood (up to four, with one samurai on the action and one in the forest for each wood you want), or&#10;    Build (up to two buildings, with two samurai on the card and one in the desired city, along with the required resources)&#10;&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players simultaneously choose which actions they want to take with their three cards and in which order, programming those actions on their player cards, similar to the planning phase in Dirk Henn's Wallenstein and Shogun. Players then take actions in turn order, moving samurai on the board as needed (paying $1 per space moved) in order to complete actions (to the forest for wood, the rice fields for rice, cities to build, and so on). Before a player can move samurai, however, he must use an action to place them on the game board; some actions allow free movement, and others allow a player to recruit additional samurai beyond the initial five.&#10;&#10;One other action allows you to recruit additional action cards from an array on the side of the game board, thereby giving you four (or more) cards from which to choose for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;Building in cities costs resources and gives you points as well as money; as more players build in a city, the funds are split among all present, with those first in the city receiving a larger share. Players can also receive points or buy stone by dealing with a traveling merchant.&#10;&#10;Once at least one player has twelve points, the game finishes at the end of the round, with players scoring endgame bonuses for money in hand and other things. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Edo includes separate game boards for 2-3 players and for 4 players.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,7.03525,6.19561,1753

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.&#10;&#10;At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!&#10;&#10;To this basic game, Star Wars Labyrinth adds one twist &ndash; a Darth Vader variant in which a Vader token starts the game on a designated tile. Whenever a player has a card that includes a small Darth Vader icon, that player needs to reach the desired symbol with Vader instead of his own token. As a result, multiple people might be trying to move Vader at the same time.

The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court.

In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down.&#10;&#10;Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game.&#10;&#10;Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause.&#10;&#10;The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations.&#10;&#10;Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,7.58493,6.90463,4508

170201,Bushido (Second edition),2013,"Bushido is a game of savage battles, of cunning stratagems and last-ditch defences, and where debts of honour are paid in blood. In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes, men and women of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the very fabric of the universe, and those with the appropriate training or natural talent can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers. In the world of Bushido, the delicate tapestry of Ki &ndash; and thus the universe itself &ndash;is threatened by the forces of imbalance, and it is up to you to protect it &ndash; or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the universe itself is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?&#10;&#10;There are currently nine factions at war within the Jwar Isles:&#10;&#10;The prefecture of Ryu&#10;The Dragon Clan won the rights to colonize the Westward Isles in a series of duels with their rivals, the Shiho Clan. However, when the Emperor's vessel expired, and his young heir, too young and inexperienced to concern himself with the petty disputes at the fringes of his lands, the promise of sole settlement rights died with him. The newly formed Prefecture of Ryu found themselves yet again in conflict with their old enemies, the Shiho Clan. Now, the Prefecture&rsquo;s grasp of power is weakened, due to the recent Tsunami. Their forces are in disarray, they are fighting on all fronts in the aftermath of the disaster. But still the men and women of the Dragon are ready to take their place at Destiny&rsquo;s table, uniting the human world by defending it against all threats.&#10;&#10;The Temple of Ro-Kan&#10;The serene martial artist masters of the Ro-Kan have long viewed themselves as above all mortal and mundane conflicts. Now, following the Han civil war, the rise of the Cult of Yurei, and the incursion of the Savage Wave, the monks of Ro-Kan are being dragged into the clandestine wars of universal balance &ndash; a war in which they will reluctantly turn out to be key players. The monks follow an age-old path and know the secrets of Ki better than any others, but they are few and divided &ndash; will they be able to unite and join forces before it is too late?&#10;&#10;The Savage Wave&#10;They take the form of evil creatures of myth and folklore. From where they come or why, no-one knows, but one thing is for certain, the wave crushes everything in its path. The Oni and Bakemono demon-creatures that make up the bulk of the Savage Wave appear bent on the destruction of humankind and all that is holy, but they are not mindless &ndash; as many opponents have found out at great pain, the Savage Wave is cunning and organized, and it operates according to its own weird and unknowable logic. Some mad hermits and outcast scholars whisper that this is not the first Savage Wave...&#10;&#10;The Cult of Yurei&#10;In the shadows and dark corners of the world, the worshippers of Yurei are gathering force. The many members of this Cult may not even be aware that they are serving the same dark masters, but serve them they do &ndash; the Yurei Bargain, which in its various forms allows control over life and death, has proven a temptation to many different people who would otherwise have nothing in common. In the Cult of Yurei, you may think yourself the master of your own Fate but you are always advancing the unfathomable goals of dark unseen masters. Even a puppet master has someone pulling his strings...&#10;&#10;The Ito&#10;The Ito have long been the laughing stock of the ruling clans. Never quite able to understand that it is their own flaws which hold their greater ambitions back. Being untrustworthy is synonymous with the Ito in the Jwar Isles; their support of the Shiho&rsquo;s rise to power followed by their treacherous role in the Dragon Wars against the very same clan, highlights their fickle nature. Now though the Ito on the island of Izu have gone through a transformation, their alliance with an age old and powerful Kami has imbued them with a new found strength. If it was the Kami that caused the snake like changes or whether it has simply exaggerated the Ito&rsquo;s natural affinity is unknown. What is sure is that the Ito finally have the power to rise against the other clans and avenge the mockery and mistreatment they have suffered. Will this venomous clan prove to be one dose of poison too much for the Jwar Isles?&#10;&#10;Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&#10;The thriving port of Jima is the beating heart of the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate&rsquo;s operations. For generations the merchants of the syndicate have been the trade life blood of the Jwar isles. From the great gambling halls, where fortunes are won or lost, on the roll of a single dice or the draw of a card. A bustling and bountiful harbour brimming with exotic goods and rare delights. Famed arenas where colossal Jumo warriors clash in a brutal dance, or an array of fighting beasts struggle in a battle to the death. Water houses where ones wildest fantasies can become reality with the touch of a Rose. Their power lies not the in military might of the Ito, Takashi or Minimoto but in the stranglehold they have on trade. And not only the trade of goods, but of the secrets and whispers of even the most pious. Some would liken the Silvermoon to the flip of a coin. Pay your debts and you come up in the sun with the fortunes smiling, cross or try to cheat them and you&rsquo;ll be in the dark and covered in dirt.&#10;&#10;Tengu Descension&#10;For countless cycles the elders of the mountain have watched and waited, their quiet vigil in the high places of the world unbroken. Silently they have over seen the rise and fall of innumerable clans, the petty squabbles of mortals bare no relevance to their goal. Gifted with generations of knowledge passed down through the written teachings of the Karasu Shugenja and oral histories of the Koroko Shisai the Tengu hold the secrets of the world in the their high homes.&#10;&#10;Now stirred into action, one can only imagine the danger that looms that has rustled the Tengu to war.&#10;&#10;Jung Pirates&#10;When years passed without word of the Jung, they were considered lost, their return under the mon of the giant squid surprised everyone. They have reaped what they need from the traders on the seas of the Jwar Isles, forcing the Shiho to label them pirates. Their fleets are faster and their knowledge of the Isles&rsquo; waters are unparalleled by all but perhaps the Carp clan, allowing them to evade the larger, less experienced junks of the Prefecture. Long years away from the courts of the Jwar Isles have left the Jung rough around the edges but they have not forgotten their ancestry.&#10;&#10;Kage Kaze Zoku&#10;The Kage Kaze Zoku (Shadow wind clan) are deadly ninjas with a grudge against just about everybody.&#10;&#10;",2,2,60,60,8.22222,0.0,27

Each tile depicts a stacked arrangement of blocks as well as a point value. On a turn, the master builder takes the sixteen tower blocks, flips the sand timer, then starts building whichever towers he wishes, with each tower being built on the tile that depicts it. Each other player is a saboteur and has 2-10 ammunition dice that she tries to shoot at the towers with her catapult (which is more like a tiny teeter-totter really). If she knocks over a tower, great! No points for the master builder, although he can use the fallen blocks to rebuild if time remains. If an ammunition die lands on a tower tile, the builder can't build on this tile; if he's started building on this tile but hasn't finished, he must stop and move elsewhere.&#10;&#10;If an ammunition die lands with the ""Ka-Boom"" symbol face-up, nothing happens. However, if a second die shows this symbol, the player who shot this die gets to slam her fist on the table once; if the ensuing earthquake knocks over towers, too bad for the builder. One player has a giant ammunition die, and this can cause an earthquake all on its own, but saboteurs can't cause more than one earthquake a round.  [Note:  The Blue Orange version of the game removes the earthquake mechanic and giant ammunition die.]&#10;&#10;When the sand timer runs out, the master builder claims any tiles on which he has correctly built a tower that still stands.

The Defense goes second, with the single objective of diverting the Offense, thus stopping it from completing a path between two opposite sides.

Remember, players are free to place pieces on any square on the board without being required to touch a previously played piece.&#10;&#10;The pathways will turn and wind and even cross over themselves as the two players attempt to out-maneuver each other.

Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium. The German high command hoped that success would force a political settlement on the Western Front, thus allowing Germany to direct its full attention to defeating the Russians. In order to win the game, the German player will almost certainly have to get some units across the Meuse River&#10;&#10;The Ardennes, a thickly wooded area on the borders of Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg, where battle weary U.S. divisions were sent to rest and replace losses, or units freshly arrived from the United States were given their first taste of front line duty. At 5:30am, December 16, 1944, this 85-mile-long sector erupted into what would be the largest, most costly campaign on the Western Front in WWII. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.&#10;&#10;During the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed. On December 22, Patton's Third Army began attacking the German southern flank north of Arlon, and on the 23rd, the weather finally cleared, allowing Allied air supremacy to be re-asserted over the battlefield.&#10;&#10;As the German player, can you break through the American player's front lines and get sufficient forces across the Meuse River before the Allies can bring enough reinforcements to the threatened sector to stop the Ardennes Offensive?

11670,The Game of Authors,1861,"Authors - One of the earliest versions of the family of Go Fish games, in which players call on each other to give up a named card, attempting to meld sets for points, based on which set of the game it is (e.g. the first melded set gets 10 points, the second gets 5 points). When all sets have been melded, most points wins.&#10;&#10;From The Card Games Website&#10;This is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.&#10;&#10;This game is often paired in the same deck with Top Trumps&#10;&#10;Happy Families - An even earlier (1851), British version with the educational theme centered on family members and their occupations.&#10;&#10;Quartett - This is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors.

The only condition on these actions is that, at the conclusion of the turn no two stones of the same color can be diagonally adjacent unless they are orthogonally connected by a common like-colored stone.&#10;&#10;Forced Passing: In the very unlikely event that a player will not have a legal move on his turn, he must pass his turn. passing is otherwise strictly prohibited.&#10;&#10;pie rule: The pie rule has questionable efficacy in classic Slither, as any stone can be translated to the middle of the board without even a loss of tempo. This rule states that&#10;&#10;No draws are possible in Slither.&#10;&#10;Advanced Slither: Seasoned Slither players may want to upgrade to Advanced Slither, which is a variant from late 2018 which aims to resolve issues generated by the perhaps excessive mobility of stones, chiefly making the pie rule less superfluous. The only additional rule in advanced Slither is that a stone may only move if its part of a contiguous orthogonal group consisting of stones of both colors. In addition to making pie more effective and foiling opening templates, this rule makes the game both more static, and therefore strategic and more tactically rich. speaking as its designer, I would have released this version of Slither if I had discovered its relative merits in 2010, despite how this may have effected Slither's reputation.&#10;&#10;",2,2,40,40,7.99302,5.61013,106

12027,Tolstoi: Wieviel Erde braucht der Mensch?,1997,"The first (?) game based on a Tolstoi short story (""How Much Ground Does a Man Need?""), this game's premise is simple:  Two to four people have paid 1000 Rubles to the Bashkirs for a ""day"" of land.  How much is a ""day""?  Well, you start on a mountaintop and begin walking.  If you come back to the mountain by sundown, you get all the land you encircle.&#10;&#10;The board is a 24x32 grid.  Each player drops a small cylinder to indicate their starting location, and then draw cards (generally) to move.  Each card indicates how far and in what direction you move (your ""boundary"" is indicated by plastic cones in your color) and how much time it took--around the board, a Sun token moves from Dawn to Dusk.  When the Sun token hits Dusk, the game is over.  If you end up back on your mountain, you get points equal to the area you have enclosed (plus how many spaces are in your boundary--for the Go-enabled, it's ""Chinese scoring"").  If you're not on your mountain, you get nothing.  If nobody is on their mountain, the Bashkirs win--just like in the story...&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,45,6.32857,0.0,7

112364,Outside the Box,2011,"ABOUT THE GAME&#10;&#10;Outside the Box&trade; was designed to be unique in many ways. First of all, the box top or cover actually becomes the game board (we don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever done this before), hence the name Outside the Box. Secondly, it is a team game (there are very few team games out there) where everyone is actively involved throughout the game. This makes it a great party game, but also gives every single player a chance to be a hero by helping his or her team win. Most importantly, Outside the Box is all skill. There are no dice. Teams can only advance by getting the answers right. It&rsquo;s very fast. It&rsquo;s very fun and it&rsquo;s very, very addictive.&#10;&#10;GAME PLAY&#10;&#10;Outside the Box&trade; consists of four types of rounds: Volley Box, Team Play, To Each His Own, and Speed Round. In most rounds, answers are given, in order, A through Z. Teams begin on the Start square with a Volley Box round. The team that wins the Volley Box moves onto the board to the first Team Play space, receives 3 PassCards, and will play the first Team Play round. As your teams progress through the game, you advance through 3 phases, and the 377 categories become more challenging. To win the game, you leave Phase 3, flip over the Start square (which reveals the Winner's Box), and attempt your Final Challenge.&#10;&#10;FOUR ROUNDS OF PLAY&#10;&#10;With four different rounds and hundreds of categories, it's like playing four games in one...so it's never the same, as it changes each time you play. Here are some examples:&#10;&#10;Team Play - You have been chosen as the Captain of your team for this round. The category is: ""Musical Groups and Rock Bands."" The timer is set for 2 minutes, and the pressure is on! You must go, in order, A through Z, and name a group or band that begins with each letter of the alphabet. Your team may help you, but only by giving you ""outside the box"" clues. Did you just say, ""That's easy?"" Ready, set, go!&#10;&#10;Volley Box - In this round, teams battle back and forth through the alphabet in a verbal hot potato! The category is: ""Things you give, share, or offer to others."" The timer is placed away from view and is set for 1 minute. Again, going in order, A through Z, the first team could shout, ""Alimony!"" The other team might respond with, ""Benefit of the doubt!"" The first team says, ""Condolences!"" (or ""Cup of sugar!"" or ""Custody!"" or ""CPR!"" or ""Coat!"") The team that is stuck when the timer beeps loses the round. Just how far ""outside the box"" will you go to help your team win?&#10;&#10;To Each His Own - The category is picked and 4 letters are randomly chosen from the alphabet. Both teams are given 2 minutes to secretly write down a response for each letter. Try not to match each other. If you're really good, you may just get the chance to ""stump the Master!""&#10;&#10;Speed Round - You are the ""Actor."" You have picked a Speed Round card and the timer is set. You must go in order through the alphabet and get your team to say exactly what is on that card. Go ahead, jump around, sing, use props -- but you better not say any part of the words on the card, or ""it sounds like"" or ""rhymes with.."" The timer is going... what are you waiting for?&#10;&#10;CONTENTS&#10;&#10;Included are 377 category cards with thousands of possible answers (which makes the game different each time you play).

198653,Don't fall in the Mead Hall,2015,"Not all of the stereotypes about Vikings were true. They were more settlers than they were raiders, for instance. They bathed more than most of their European peers, and were quite fond of jewelry and fancy duds. One thing continues to hold true though. They loved to party, and would often hold feasts in mead halls (community longhouses) that lasted many days. The primary drink at these feasts was mead (honey wine or beer), and competitions were held to see who could hold their drink the longest while remaining standing and spouting poetry eloquently (yes, Vikings were some of the earliest poets).&#10;&#10;In Don&rsquo;t Fall in the Mead Hall, players emulate a host of Vikings drinking the night away in a mead hall. Although drinking while playing is encouraged, this is more of a party game with a fair share of strategy than it is a straight-up drinking game. Each player controls a table that starts with four Vikings (multi-colored pawns). A six-sided die is placed on the table with the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; facing up. This is the drunk die or &ldquo;Odin&rsquo;s Breathalyzer.&rdquo; &#10; After each player rolls a 20-sided die to determine initiative for the round, they then take turns rolling the action die. The results of the action die vary from taking a drink, to sending a drink to another table, to calling out a &ldquo;skal&rdquo; (toast) to cause all of the tables to drink, to throwing a chair at another table, to challenging another Viking at the battle mat. Each drink the Vikings at your table take causes the drunk die to move up by one. Taking a drink while the die is on six will result in a passed out Viking. The player lays that Viking on its side by the table (that Viking is out of the game), then sets the drunk die back to one. &#10; Vikings are also out of the game if they lose at the battle mat. Battle is performed by rolling the attack dice. Either one player wins, both players get knocked down, or nothing happens (two blanks are rolled) because the Vikings are too drunk to fight. Additionally, Vikings will move from table to table for various reasons depending on the die roll. Players do not have ultimate control over any of the Vikings but rather control a table. Once all of their Vikings have passed out, been knocked out, or have moved onto another table, they are out of the game. They still have a chance to get back in the game if gameplay results in a Viking being sent back to their empty table. The player controlling the table with the last Viking standing in the mead hall is the winner.&#10;&#10;Contains small parts for easy traveling (but not for swallowing!).

If you draw an Always card you will do the wacky thing on your card every time it's your turn. A Whenever card directs you to do what the card says whenever another player does something specific. One wacky thing definitely leads to another in this zany game of craziness!&#10;&#10;SET UP&#10;&#10;     3 players randomly choose a prop card&#10;     Shuffle the action cards and put them facedown in a pile within reach of all players&#10;     Decide how many rounds to play.

Each time you draw an action card, add it to the row of action cards in front of you.&#10;     Read the action card aloud to all the players very carefully. Each card has a point value 1-12 based on the zaniness of the action.  &#10;     There are two types of action cards:&#10;         Always-if you draw an always card, do the zany thing immediately. Then repeat that zany thing every time it's your turn. &#10;         Whenever-if you draw a whenever card, do nothing right now.

There are 3 different prop cards:&#10;         Funny Glasses-when you have this card, wear the glasses until someone stands for any reason.

Then pass the glasses and card to the player on your left. &#10;         Microphone-when you have this card, hold the microphone until someone sings. Then sing into the microphone along with them.

212401,Leningrad '41,2017,"This is VentoNuovo's continuation of the system created for Moscow '41, now looking at the campaign of Army Group North in Barbarossa. The final chapter of the Trilogy is Kiev '41.&#10;&#10;Players take either the German or Soviet Union forces and use colorful wooden blocks to simulate the forces they have involved.&#10;&#10;Leningrad '41 uses the same basic game engine of Moscow '41, with a few tweaks and changes to suit the differing conditions in the north. The game brings new wrinkles in as well because the Germans have ""allies"" as part of their forces-- the small but powerful Finnish Army which sought to recover territory lost in the ""Winter War"" but did not fully match the ambitions of Germany at destroying the U.S.S.R.&#10;&#10;Four weeks after the commencement of Barbarossa, Hitler visited the headquarters of Army Group North.  The F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s words were dutifully noted in the army group&rsquo;s war diary, and culminated in the following observation: &ldquo;&hellip;the loss of Leningrad might result in a complete collapse.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;By the end of the third week in July the capture of Leningrad did indeed seem inevitable.  The Germans had already covered more than half the distance to the city.  And yet, as they advanced into the vastness of Russia, it appeared that everyone on the Axis side of things had a different plan; and as time went by, those plans had a habit of changing.&#10;&#10;Hitler did not want his tanks entering the city; but then, he did not want his infantry engaged in prolonged street fighting either.  So, after another think about things, the F&uuml;hrer decided the city should be simply cut off and starved, or relentlessly bombarded and starved&hellip; or the Finns would be welcome to breach Lake Lagoda and flood it.  Whatever the means, the F&uuml;hrer purposed that the &ldquo;Cradle of Bolshevism&rdquo; was to be wiped off the face of the earth, and its population left to dwindle away to nothing.&#10;&#10;The problem was, despite the rush of victories, or perhaps because of them, the Germans had precious little idea what to do next. Halder wrote that July: &ldquo;&hellip;there seem to certain differences in von Leeb&rsquo;s and Hoepner&rsquo;s views of what the next moves should be.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;They waited to be told what to do, or argued between themselves.  Manstein, commanding one of Army Group North&rsquo;s panzer corps, knew what to do, but he was not in charge of the operation.  Delays accrued, brought on by lack of supply and the first recovery of Soviet forces.  Already within one short drive of Leningrad, the Finns were meant to help, but the Finns had their own plans; and, for the time being, they did not involve doing more than reclaiming what they had lost in the Winter War.&#10;&#10;And what of Stalin?  Beyond the speeches, the threats and the executions, he sent Zhukov to the city in early September 1941, and there the man who would eventually oversee the fall of Berlin organized the workers&rsquo; militias and planned a defence that was meant to face the expected German onslaught - an onslaught, which as the weeks went by, never actually came. &#10; As the German player, in reaching for a victory that will have meaning, you are up against the clock, the terrain, and alongside Soviet resistance, the loss of units that some other bright idea from somewhere else will impose upon you.  The forces of Army Group North are not huge, so you must act to avoid your units being dispersed, and have victory in your grasp before another plan takes the panzers away from you.&#10;&#10;As the Soviet player you must know what to defend and what to abandon.  You cannot be strong everywhere.  Limited time is the best ally of those defending with limited forces.  Encourage the Germans to use their time up.&#10;&#10;",1,2,30,120,8.06806,5.57576,72

1887,Legend of the Five Rings,1995,"A collectible card game, set in a fantasy empire called Rokugan, based loosely upon medieval Japan and Japanese Mythology.&#10;&#10;The factions available have changed over the editions, but generally include the 7 Great Clans: Crab, Crane, Dragon, Lion, Phoenix, Scorpion, and Unicorn. Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.&#10;&#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.&#10;&#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say ""I'm a Crab player"" you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.&#10;&#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.&#10;&#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: &#10;&#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.&#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.&#10;     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.&#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game&#10;&#10;&#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.&#10;&#10;In 2008, L5R held the first ""Mega-Game"" which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.&#10;&#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.&#10;&#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.&#10;&#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.&#10;&#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.&#10;&#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017.

After the rolls, the player will have gathered three numbers, which are then matched up to particular ""gut"" (ie, combination).  A couple are poker-like (two of a kind, three of a kind), while a few other guts are preset (for example, 6-9-2 is called Aphrodite's Smile).&#10;&#10;The first slice consists of rolling all three dice, keeping two and throwing one away.  You must remember the two numbers AND remember which number came from which die.  As an example (to assist in describing the next slices), you roll green-2 purple-9 red-7 and decide to keep the purple and red dice.&#10;&#10;The second slice consists of re-rolling the two kept dice.  You must then throw out of of those two dice, and keep the two numbers from the kept die.  To continue the example, you re-roll the purple and red dice and get purple-1 red-3.  You decide to keep the purple, which means your two numbers are 9 (from the first slice) and 1 (from this slice).&#10;&#10;The third slice consists of rerolling the die chosen for your third number. To continue the example, you reroll purple and get 5, making your three numbers 9, 1 and 5.  These can now be arranged in any order and compared against the scoring table to determine poker-like ranking against other players in the same round.  Highest gut wins.&#10;&#10;One minor exception are ""The Loads"", which are guts that must be matched against all three dice in the first slice only.

With one map and a limited number of counters it's an excellent introduction to the series.&#10;&#10;August 29, 1756: The Seven Years War erupts in Europe. The Prussian army led by King Frederick II (later ""the Great"" to his admirers) invades Saxony. ""Blitzing"" through the neutral Saxon electorate he hopes to open a path to Austria&rsquo;s rich Elbe River valley in Bohemia. The Saxon army does not directly resist the invaders but withdraws into a fortified encampment on the Elbe River around Pirna, there awaiting rescue by the Austrians. The Prussian invasion grinds to a halt here; Frederick has no choice but to lay siege. Meanwhile in northern Bohemia, the Austrian army under Field Marshal Browne gathers its strength in preparation for the relief of its new ally.&#10;&#10;Retaining the initiative King Frederick split his army, leaving half to keep the Saxons penned in Pirna, while he marches with the rest into Bohemia in search of the Austrians. On the morning of October 1, they stumble onto Browne&rsquo;s army deployed around the little town of Lobositz on the Elbe River. A close fought, ten hour struggle ensues, with charge and counter-charges made across fog masked fields, hills and vineyards before culminating in a street fight amidst burning buildings. Finally, at darkness, the Austrians withdraw in good order, conceding the field.&#10;&#10;Although a small battle by Seven Years War standards, the action at Lobositz was significant for having delayed the Austrian relief effort enough to force the Saxon surrender at Pirna. Of greater significance, the Prussians learned that their enemy &ldquo;was no longer the same old Austrians&rdquo; they had previously faced, and a quick victory could not be expected. Lobositz would be the first of many battles in a war to last seven bloody years.&#10;&#10;(source: the Clash of arms Website and user's description)&#10;&#10;",2,2,360,360,8.05571,5.63331,149

102346,Guns of the Askari,2012,"(from ATO website :)&#10;&#10;Guns of the Askari (GoA) recreates the imperial struggle for East Africa during WWI. This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.&#10;&#10;Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.&#10;&#10;The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.&#10;&#10;The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!&#10;&#10;Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders?

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.&#10;&#10;The objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.&#10;&#10;This procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.&#10;&#10;Each detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.&#10;&#10;",2,7,45,75,7.26038,6.45224,2644

Play alternates between attacking and defending.  The attacker selects a region in the opponent's country that borders either the common border or one of the previously captured regions.  The attacker and the defender each secretly select a set of contiguous numbers from their grid of numbers.  The attacker selects from three to six and the defender selects one to three numbers.  The product of the attackers numbers is divided by the product of the defenders numbers.  If the resulting value is larger than the region number, the attacker colors the  region in.  If the  value is lower,  the defender colors the region in.  Once a region is colored in, it may not change hands again.  Numbers used in attack or defense may not be used again either.&#10;&#10;A player wins when the other capital is captured or when he seals off all paths to his own capital.

At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!&#10;&#10;No one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.&#10;&#10;The Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!&#10;&#10;Oh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.&#10;&#10;",1,4,10,30,6.43414,5.55399,169

Players lay one card on a private pile of a certain colour. The piles can be ascending or descending, but this choice can only made once. Once a card is legally added to a pile the player can choose to advance one of his playing pieces on one of the paths on the board. If one playing piece reaches a chit the chit is removed and gives points or if its a gemstone can be taken by the player. When the public card pile is exhausted the game is over. Players get points according to the advancement of their playing pieces (-2 to +10 points are possible on each path) and for each gemstone they collected (0 gemstones = -3, 1 gemstone = -1, 2 gemstones = 2, 3 gemstones = 3 4 gemstones = 6, all 5 gemstones = 10 points).

It tells how the peerless prince Siegfried from Xanten in the Netherlands, comes to Worms to court the beautiful Kriemhild.  However, King Gunther and his two brothers jealously guard their sister Kriemhild.  Gunther wishes to win the hand of Brunhild of Iceland, but she will only marry the man who can win three contests against her mighty strength.  Gunther and Siegfried strike a pact, whereby Siegfried will help Gunther win Brunhild's hand and in return he may marry Kriemhild.  Using his magic cloak, Siegfried secretly assists Gunther to defeat Brunhild, both on the field and in the bedchamber.  Unfortunately, Siegfried keeps Brunhild's ring and girdle, and ultimately bestows them upon his wife Kriemhild.  A small grievance leads the queens to fight, the ring and girdle are produced, and Brunhild is humiliated.   She enlists Hagen, the chief vassal of Gunther, to help her get vengeance, and Gunther and Hagen murder Siegfried while out hunting.  Kriemhild swears to exact revenge, marries the recently widowed King Etzel (Attila the Hun) and finally invites Hagen and her brothers to Attila's court, where in a crescendo of battle and blood, everyone dies and honour is redeemed.&#10;&#10;Siegfried and Brunhild are clearly destined for each other, and in older versions of the story he is betrothed to her, but is bewitched away by Kriemhild.  The Natural Order would be that Brunhild is won fairly and that Siegfried may marry any woman that he chooses.  The forces of Tragic Destiny twist the natural order so that Brunhild is tricked by Gunther and Siegfried, or that Hagen and Gunther murder Siegfried to obtain his magic cloak.&#10;&#10;",2,2,10,10,8.5,0.0,2

So in the spirit of good natured rivalry, you'll stock your bars with the best beer and attract the town's best customers. May the best bar win!&#10;&#10;Draft Beer is a pick and pass drafting game for 2-6 players, taking approximately 20 minutes to play. There are three rounds where you draft 8 cards, and at the end of each round you will use those cards to attract customers from the town to your bar to score points. The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;The cards are double-sided with the front having beers and food that you draft, while the back has the various customers in the town. Each round, players are dealt 8 cards to draft, and 5/6/7 customers will be dealt into the ""town"" (depending on round). Beer cards have 3 symbols, representing qualities: color, price and taste. These qualities each have 3 possibilities; light, dark, cheap, malty, etc... Customer cards have a point value, and one or two qualities they are looking for. So they may want cheap, light beers, or maybe dark expensive beers. After all the cards have been drafted, players will reveal their bar's selection, then go through the customers one by one to determine which bar they go to. The player whose bar has the most symbols they want is where they will go, and on a tie they will patronize both bars equally (awarding VP chits to all tied players).  Customers are kept until the end of the game for scoring.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are two other kinds of cards: salty snacks and bar food. These can attract customers, and are kept between rounds to score you points at the end of the game. The players with the most of each will get points.&#10;&#10;Once all three rounds have completed, the player with the most points has the most successful bar and is the winner!&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",2,6,20,30,0.0,0.0,0

While investigating, if you figure that out, it is your solemn duty to aid the monster. Will the Fallen Angel call on you for redemption, or are you already a pawn of the Vampire? Each player has six turns, shown by the heat die, to figure this out.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is straightforward.  You take an action and then move, or move and then take an action.  Actions consist of investigating, meaning picking up a green, red or blue skill die, rolling however many you've collected of that color, and then checking the reference card.  ""Calling it in"" where you help or hinder your fellow agents by announcing how, who, or what, or making a raid on a cult compound, or monster lair.&#10;&#10;Because of how easy setup is, and how quick gameplay is, this is the perfect game to share with friends.

If you can make it through seven rooms you're pretty good; if you can make it through ten rooms you can call yourself an epic hero, worthy of bards tales from here until the end of time.  But be warned - sometimes the best laid plans fall apart once you set foot in the dungeon.&#10;&#10;The mechanics of the game are easy.  Flip over a room card which gives you bonuses/penalties/adjustments.  Deal out monster cards (the same number as the number of heroes who entered the dungeon).  Order them by their Initiative score.  Then fight.&#10;&#10;Fighting is dead simple - if you can do basic math you can play.  Take your hero's attack value, roll a 20-sided die (included) and add them together.  Subtract the monster's defense value and if what's left is more than 10 it's a hit.  Subtract your hero's damage from the monster's hit points (represented by cubes) then move to the next hero or monster in line.  Once you get to the end you start again until either all the heroes or all the monsters are defeated.&#10;&#10;But don't let that fool you - this isn't a ""beat level 1 monsters, then move to level 2"" kind of dungeon.

You levy an army and advance towards Talos. Travelling through different realms you will meet hordes of hostile creatures and slay each and every enemy standing in the way of your cherished goal. In Talos, you will find an immense stronghold and will have to face an army of guards that surely won&rsquo;t  let you in. What should you do to them? You will have to defeat them, of course. Finally, drained by the numerous bloody battles, having most of your loyal troops you take over Talos City to only find another three conquerors and understand that only one will survive&hellip;&#10;&#10;At the start, each player creates a hero by selecting one of 7 available classes and a set of basic skills.

To do that, your hero will need to develop a certain type of a character and gain a required number of character points by choosing corresponding options when playing an Event Cards. At the same time, limited by a selected type of character, the player might have to face some very tough choices. For instance, choosing the &ldquo;Evil&rdquo; option in an Event Card obliges you to make an assault upon a fortress (which is a very uneasy task). This is where players might start asking themselves if they really are that evil? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be in their benefit to choose the &ldquo;Good&rdquo; option to avoid danger?  The choice is up to the player&hellip;&#10;&#10;The game&rsquo;s signature feature is the combat system. In the beginning of the battle, the player arranges his troops in his part of the battlefield. After that, the same arrangement is implemented by the creatures of the realm in which the combat is taking place. The player to the left plays for the creatures&rsquo; army. Striving towards their own victory, the players&rsquo; key task in such action will be to play for time and inflict maximal losses to the opponent. The battle process is a turn-by-turn attacks of the opponents&rsquo; units until a complete defeat or retreat of one of the armies. Smart tactics, clever manoeuvring and right order of actions is the key to winning the battle. After the battle is over, the player will have to restore and heal the troops injured in combat. Smart battle timing is also very important: if the fight takes too much time, it delays the players reaching Talos City, entering which sooner than other players is one of the games&rsquo; priorities.&#10;&#10;The player needs to be well prepared to fight the Guards of Talos. The long way you have to make through the realms of the game is designed to prepare for victory by collecting and improving your skills, army, spells and artefacts. If you fail to develop your assets to a sufficient level there is a major risk that taking over Talos City will become an overwhelming task. Having a strong army but lacking resources to cast spells, the player will suffer too many casualties which will further lead to losing to other, better prepared, players.

5656,France 1944: The Allied Crusade in Europe,1986,"(David A. Vandenbroucke review - http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt):&#10;&#10;France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.&#10;&#10;Complexity is rated as ""low,"" and solitaire suitability is ""medium.""  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.&#10;&#10;For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.&#10;&#10;The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).&#10;Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.&#10;&#10;",2,2,360,360,6.19625,5.5458,184

The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.&#10;&#10;While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.&#10;&#10;The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.&#10;&#10;",2,6,15,15,5.86806,5.50008,67
13875,Quoridor Junior,2004,"The game of mice and mazes has children scurrying their mice to the opposite side of the playing board. It is not a simple task though, as each player may move their mouse 1 space at a time or decide to install a ""blocker"" to delay their opponent. Yet the maze that is built may cause delays for every mouse, including their own, as it approaches the finish line.&#10;&#10;Quoridor Kid is 7 x 7 as opposed to Quoridor&#039;s 9 x 9.

153891,Flip Flash,2014,"Each player gets their own deck, and builds a down pile. Then they deal out four cards face-up next to it. As soon as everyone is ready, someone shouts ""GO!"" and all the players simultaneously begin starting number piles in the center of the table, and playing on each others number piles.&#10;&#10;The number piles are not removed from the table for the duration of the round, and continue to grow and change very rapidly throughout the game. Players can play a card higher, or lower than whatever number is showing on the top of any given pile, but they do need to be sure to match the color of the pile. Also, players can place a wild card on any pile and announce a number, and a color, and then play a card higher or lower than the number they called, in the new color on that pile.&#10;&#10;The speed and excitement build until someone who has played all of their down pile shouts ""Flip Flash!"" and everyone must stop. Next, the players gather and sort all of the cards that have been played in the center of the table and sort them, so that each player can count up how many cards they played. The score is figured by taking the number of cards that were played, and subtracting double the number of cards that were still in each players down pile.&#10;&#10;WHAT MAKES FLIP FLASH DIFFERENT:&#10;The ability to play up or down on the number piles, and the wild card twist, speed up the game by making sure that you rarely stay stuck for long! The number piles are never capped off, or removed from play during a round, and players flip through their hand-deck one card at a time. The three suits keeps things interesting, but limits confusion as well.&#10;&#10;Flip Flash is different than Nay-Jay! in the number and design of the cards, and a rule change. Flip Flash includes 4 decks of 60 cards each.&#10;&#10;",1,4,5,5,6.33333,0.0,6

If you manage to create such a connection on your turn, say, building a track so that you have a connected line from Ukraine to Germany, you draw the top point card from the stack for each of these two countries. Their point value is arranged in descending order, which means that the players who are the first to draw cards receive more points. If you later connect this network to the Czech Republic, then you'd draw the top card from each of the three countries' card stacks &mdash; assuming that a country's cards haven't all been claimed, of course.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,60,7.4613,5.985,748

Play continues until a word is finished that cannot be extended.  If a player is successfully challenged (a &lsquo;finished&rsquo; word can still be extended) the player forfeits a knowledge card.  The spin card is used when a player can&rsquo;t think of a way of extending a word or bluffing.  When a player loses both their knowledge cards they become a non-entity and are out of the game.  However they still play a role.  Non-entities must be completely ignored.  If a surviving player acknowledges a non-entity they lose a knowledge card.

But if more than one player deceives, then all deceivers lose out and those who chose to deal stay out of the fray.

36887,Waterloo,2009,"Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com&#10;&#10;Waterloo &ndash; a two-player game for early 2009 with the French and British fighting once again. The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.&#10;&#10;Damage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.&#10;&#10;Control of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched. The French win if they take Mont St. Jean, the British if they take Rosonne; if neither occurs before the end of 8pm (ie the last turn), then the British and Allies win.&#10;&#10;",2,2,180,180,6.89329,5.71913,407

The rules are available in Japanese and English. (In Japan, the standard deck of Western playing cards is known as a 'Trump' deck. Hence the designer explaining the game as a 'Trump Extension' game.)&#10;&#10;Cards numbered A, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two jokers are investment cards. Five cards each are dealt to the players. Cards numbered 6-10 are tax haven cards. Players try to earn positive tax haven cards by playing investing cards.&#10;&#10;When you invest on a tax haven card, you place a card stand along a border of the tax haven card and insert an investment card you want to play, so that one player cannot see how much you invest. Up to four players can invest on a tax haven card, and the highest investor earns the face value of that tax haven card. But one pre-determined suit counts negative, and a joker also inverts the sign if involved. You should speculate about hidden cards and try to let negative points go to other investors.&#10;&#10;You can co-operate with one of other players by sharing complete information about what you play.

Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action.

The time for diplomacy has long since passed. The time for advanced warmongering is upon us.&#10;&#10;COMMAND CARDS:&#10;&#10;One of the biggest differences from the classic game is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, nuclear, and diplomat. These fill a number of roles with the most basic function being to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided dice rather than the typical six-sided, but perhaps the most important function of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of cards of various types. The addition of these cards, and in particular the addition of the Advanced Tech command deck, has a huge effect upon the gaming dynamics. With the addition of these cards the board is opened up making no position impregnable and no attack a certainty. With these cards in use, the game is more fluid with gaming positions and strategies needing to be constantly shifted&#10;&#10;RULE VARIATIONS:&#10;&#10;The Advanced Tech cards are designed for use as command cards alongside the original sets provided with the standard game. No additional commander token has been provided as it is suggested that the Advanced Tech cards be used in place of the Diplomat cards. If preferred, the Advanced Tech cards can be used in conjunction with additional tokens, representative of an additional commander, therefore allowing the use of all five of the original commanders as well.&#10;&#10;Advanced Tech 2nd Edition&#10;&#10;Released in its original form in the summer of 2007, this twenty card expansion deck was then re-released in January 2008 sporting some new wording and improved graphics. Like our other decks, the Advanced Tech Command Deck is designed to be used alongside the original game and can either be used in place of an existing command deck of the players choice or with the use of additional command tokens available from our online store.&#10;Second edition adds +1 Landmine and subtracts the one Subliminal Orders&#10;&#10;- Landmine (Cost 1 to be played at beginning of turn before any attacks): This card allows the playing player to draw a land territory card which they then place secretly in front of them. The next time an opponent attacks the territory shown, that player loses Mods equal to half of a D6 dice roll.&#10;&#10;Expands:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Risk 2210 A.D.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,90,7.10526,0.0,19

Players then take quick turns playing actions that allow them to move their explorers around the world map, excavate for artifacts, and deploy traders to bazaars and influencers to affect prices and wheel and deal on the black market.&#10;&#10;The artifacts you dig up can be either sold to the bazaars housed on one of the aliens' ships that landed on Earth or added to a collection that will be sold off as a coherent art collection to museums back home. Excavation Earth ends after three rounds and the player who makes the most money during the game wins.&#10;&#10;Excavation Earth includes a solo mode by Nick Shaw and D&aacute;vid Turczi.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,4,30,120,7.16679,6.14904,1449

6752,Attack!,2003,"The basic game (Attack!) is a very simple game of expansion and conflict set in the World War 2 era. It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;Each player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their ""sphere of influence"". This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).&#10;&#10;There are three major sub-games in Attack!:&#10;1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.&#10;&#10;3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire ""set"" (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of ""1"" that represents a region without any special economic value (just ""population"").&#10;&#10;The units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.&#10;The map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa). The expansion contains the map of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Attack!: Expansion&#10;    Attack! Deluxe Expansion (Replaces Attack!

For instance, Cattle are added to a player&rsquo;s wealth in Spring, with Warriors flocking to banners in the Summer. Wealth is acquired from the wilds during the harvest time of Autumn, with the Harvest Feast of Samhain occurring at the end of that season. At the Harvest Feast, players are required to feed those Warriors they wish to remain under their banner. Winter is a time of hunting, raiding, and politicking, when fortunes can change in a heartbeat.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player accumulates enough wealth or warriors to force the issue and cause the others to acknowledge them as High King.&#10;&#10;The game has been heavily influenced by the history and mythology of the ancient Celts, and the advanced version of the game incorporates the mythology into the game-play.&#10;&#10;The game uses our Celtic Myth playing cards as game components, with one deck being sufficient for a 2-player game, two decks being recommended for 3 to 4-player games, and all three decks being recommended for 5-player games.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,90,6.33333,0.0,3

There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the ""Intruder Control""--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,4.5,0.0,13

If the guess was incorrect, it costs a nut-chip and the team stone also is not being moved.&#10;&#10;You can only win together when the team reaches the finish. In addition, the player with the most nut chips is then also the team winner. The team can just as well lose together, because we know that the Gruffalo is sometimes a pretty bad guy, which is not to be trusted so completely. Therefore, there are also shadows in the game for which there is - how mean! - no matching scene on the board. As it is, be extra careful then and be not deceived by the Gruffalo.

While the safest course would be withdraw into Virginia, rest the army and seek battle on another day, Robert E. Lee decides to stand and fight at Sharpsburg.&#10;&#10;On the Union side, George B. McClellan is no longer as confident of victory as he was a few days ago, when the discovery of Lee's marching orders gave Little Mac all the information he needed to defeat the enemy in detail.

While McClellan is sure he faces an enemy that vastly outnumbers him, he must fight and win here to preserve the Union.&#10;&#10;This is the second edition of In their Quiet fields, the very first Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series game.

Brettspiel retains the central element of the 6 nimmt! card game: Each player reveals a card from their hand at the same time, then the cards are added to a central display with players possibly being penalized should their card end up in the wrong location.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the game includes tiles numbered 1-100, and each player receives a hand of twelve tiles. Four tiles are revealed at random and placed in the first position of the first four rows on the game board. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, then reveals them all at the same time, with the tiles being added to the game board from lowest number to highest. A tile is placed in a row to the right of a tile with a lower value, with the smallest difference between tiles mattering should multiple options be available. (For example, a 16 would be placed to the right of 14 and not 7 should both of those numbers be present in different rows.) If a tile is lower than all rightmost tiles, then you place it to the right of the tile with the highest value.&#10;&#10;If the tile is placed on a space with a positive or negative bullhead symbol, the player gains or loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their played tile. If the tile fills the final spot in a row, then the player loses points equal to the sum of bullheads on all other cards in this row, then this card is moved down the game board to the first position in the highest empty row.&#10;&#10;Once everyone has played all of their tiles &mdash; or in a two- or three-player game, refilled their hand, then played through a second set of twelve tiles &mdash; the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;If you like, you can play 6 nimmt! Brettspiel with ""good luck cards"". Whenever you score negative points, you draw such a card from the deck. These cards either convert a non-final row space on the game board to +5 points (instead of whatever it was) or convert a final row space to a bonus that might end up netting you points instead of losing them.&#10;&#10;On the back of the 6 nimmt! Brettspiel game board is a second board to be used with the ""professional version"" of the game. In addition to the &plusmn;bullhead spaces, this board has spaces that force you to draw a new tile, claim all the tiles in a row (instead of scoring negative points), or draw an action card. These action cards let you play anywhere, swap your played tile for another from your hand, skip to the front line, and more. This version can be played with or without the ""good luck cards"". When one player is out of tiles, players lose points for the bullheads on tiles still in hand.&#10;&#10;",2,6,25,25,6.53065,5.59905,242

Your long-term goal is to manipulate the market value of certain styles of artwork, while also earning points by placing paintings in the museum.&#10;&#10;The game includes paintings from five styles of art &mdash; Art Nouveau, Pop Art, Renaissance, Surrealism, and Impressionism &mdash; and you start with five random painting cards in your deck. Each art style starts with a value of 1 gold for a painting. You also have five starting gold cards in your deck, with the cards being worth 1 or 2 gold, with some cards having a special ability on them.&#10;&#10;To start the game, shuffle your deck, then take five cards in hand. Fill the four galleries with 2-3 random paintings each, then place two random 3-gold cards (each with a special power) in the bank, along with the deck of 5-gold cards. Paintings in galleries cost 1-8 gold, while gold cards cost 5 or 8 gold. On a turn, take two actions from these three choices, repeating an action, if desired:&#10;&#10;&bull; Haggle: Discard a card from your hand to draw two cards from your deck.&#10;&bull; Acquire: Pay the acquisition cost of a painting or gold card by discarding cards from your hand, then place that card in your discard pile. Increase the ""market rating"" of the painting's art style or gold by the value listed in the gallery/bank. As the market rating of an art style increases, each painting in that style is worth more gold, effectively increasing its buying power; that art style is also worth more points at game's end.&#10;&bull; Exhibit: Pay the exhibition cost for a gallery, then place a painting into that gallery that matches one of that gallery's invitation markers. (A gallery might want, for example, 2 Impressionistic paintings, 1 Renaissance painting, and 1 painting of any type.) Mark that painting with one of your ownership tokens, then place the related invitation marker on the highest available victory point (VP) space, scoring those points for yourself immediately. That painting is now removed from your deck.&#10;&#10;If you use the special ability on a gold card instead of its listed numerical value, remove that card from the game.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, discard any number of cards from your hand, then refill your hand to five cards. If a gallery has no paintings in it, refill all of the galleries with 2-3 paintings, then replace each empty gallery's cost token with the next highest one available. When at least twelve paintings are in the museum, the painting deck is empty, or an art style or gold reaches a market rating of 70, finish the round, then proceed to final scoring.&#10;&#10;The value of gold depends on its market rating, with its value ratio ranging from 6:1 to 1:1. Each painting in your deck is worth 1-7 VPs depending on the market rating of its art style. Each exhibition space in the museum also has a random bonus that was revealed at the start of play, and you can earn additional points through these bonuses.

Each figure represents one person.&#10;&#10;Each player controls one ""unit"" of 20 figures and is given one 52-card deck of ordinary playing cards, which are used instead of dice in this game.  Each unit has one chit (or 3x5 card) used to determine activation randomly in a given turn.&#10;&#10;Units are distinguished by a bar of color on the base: since ten players can be playing at once, and there are no uniforms in that era, this is important.  A number of stripes (from 0 to 3) on the color bar shows the morale level of the figure, from militia to average to proven veteran to elite veteran (leader).  This is important both in melee combat and morale checks.&#10;&#10;Pigs are a frequent goal of a given scenario, hence the name of the game.  In fact, different units are given different objectives in a raid scenario, though things don't always work out the way one intends ... it can get a bit chaotic.&#10;&#10;Cards are used to determine all random events: missile fire, combat, rallying, morale checks, etc.  The system is very easy to understand and there is very little in terms of a player aid needed.  The only downside to the card method is that a player goes through his entire deck before reshuffling, and if he notices all the good cards have been used early, it may change his tactics half way through the game as he becomes more conservative ...&#10;&#10;Overall, a good light system, more for ""fun"" gaming than serious gaming.&#10;&#10;",2,10,30,30,6.30952,0.0,21

140934,Arboretum,2015,"Arboretum is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, aged 10 and up, that combines set collection, tile-laying and hand management while playing in about 25 minutes. Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors.&#10;&#10;The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.&#10;&#10;When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color.

It's your job to supply her with the wool from her flock of happy sheep; the fleece of four sheep will meet her needs.&#10;&#10;However, she only wants wool of one colour- either black or white. And since her sheepdog Fang ran off with a Bichon Frise last year, those four sheep will need to be within arms reach for you to gather them in.&#10;&#10;Will you be the one who gathers the four sheep first, thereby winning Aunt Dolly&rsquo;s biggest smile- and the biggest scone?&#10;&#10;Happy Sheep is a fast, fun game of strategy, memory and bluffing. It takes 15 seconds to set up, two minutes to learn, and five minutes to stop laughing when you trick someone into crying ""Happy Sheep"" and proving they don&rsquo;t know black from white.&#10;&#10;Includes strategies for gamers and a simple variant for very young kids.&#10;&#10;How to play: &#10;Mix the 20 tiles (10 black, 10 white) face down and form them into a 4x5 flock. On their turn, a player slides out one tile and looks at it. If it's one of the 4 show-off sheep, they show everyone and put it back in the same place. Otherwise, they may rejoin the sheep to the flock face-down wherever they please.&#10;&#10;As soon as any player thinks they know where four sheep of the same colour are in a 2x2 group, they yell ""Happy Sheep"" and turn over the four tiles. If they're right, they win; if not, they're out and play continues.&#10;&#10;It sounds simple, but with other players moving tiles, bluffing and sabotaging, it's easy to get beaten to the win or tricked into calling incorrectly.&#10;&#10;For strategic players, the backs of the tiles come in with and without daisies, so by some careful calculation it is possible to improve your decisions...&#10;&#10;",2,4,5,5,4.625,0.0,4

Opp, is preparing to leave for another tour through war-torn Europe. Tonight she has invited you to a private dinner party at that famous New York City hotel, the Alldorph Hysteria, where she often performs when she is stateside. After dinner, Miss Opp will debut her latest song, written by Big Band leader, Harry Lumbar. What a wonderful opportunity to see her perform before she and her troupe leave for the front lines, to nobly entertain our brave soldiers for Christmas on her upcoming USO tour. Yes, it's sure to be a night filled with glitz and glamor, as the stars come out to show their stuff. But you know what they say about stars: They always burn brightest before they die . . .&#10;&#10;Your Dinner Companions Include:&#10;&#10;Constance Leigh Wyning, who epitomizes the beauty and dazzle of a USO singer. Always effervescent, she gurgles with talent, motivating our boys abroad to ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" Yet her sparkle is more than skin deep; she's a home grown girl from the Midwest, a real American sweetheart, discovered and brought to the stage by Bea B. Opp herself.&#10;&#10;Tito Tellar is a man of great mystery and intrigue. Though very little is known about Tito, he's often been seen traveling across Europe, never far from the front lines.

Yet oddly enough, no one seems to know where he comes from, or for that matter, where he's been.&#10;&#10;Major Hornswagle ""Horn"" D. Augge, is the military man in charge of Bea B.

Spunky, gutsy, and known to dress in either great glitz or her flying fatigues, she always personalizes her outfits with a monogram.&#10;&#10;Oliver ""Ol"" W. Ashedup, is Miss Opp's agent and manager. A shrewd and charismatic businessman, without him, Bea wouldn't be where she is now. Ol is the kind of man who enjoys working hard, but likes to play just as hard. When he's not busy promoting his star, he's a happy-go-lucky, modern man of the 40s, who's not afraid to have a little fun once in a while.&#10;&#10;Harry Lumbar is a world-renowned Big Band leader, one of the country's finest. His songs are heard in every dance hall in the free world, and hummed in the homes of his fans everywhere. The name Harry Lumbar can hardly be mentioned without being followed with such descriptions as ""brilliant"" or ""genius."" Personally, Harry thrives on his stardom, especially since he worked so hard to get where he is. Cordially charming and never too busy for his public, his stints in the USO show have only made him even more popular than ever.&#10;&#10;Winona ""Wi"" Bauther, is the youngest daughter of that famous Vaudeville family act, the Royal Bauthers.

The main object of the game is to get 10 points, mostly by having your mice get food from the refrigerator back into the mouse-hole. The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered ""Clobbered"" and cannot function until the next turn. Most items give a strength modifier but some items have special effects. In the basic game, you get 4 points for having your mice get a piece of food back to the mouse-hole, and 1 point when your cat clobbers an opponent's mouse. Optional rules include rules for variable points for the different types of food (cheese, drumstick, apple)&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,6.14286,0.0,7

41100,King Philip's War,2010,"International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.&#10;&#10;King Philip&rsquo;s War, is about an all but forgotten New England Indian Uprising that nearly brought the Puritans to their knees. In the end, over 6000 Indians were slain or captured and sold into slavery. Over 2600 Colonials were captured or killed. In the end King Philip (The Wampanoag sachem, Metacomet) himself was ambushed, beheaded, and quartered. King Philip's hands were sent to the authorities in Plymouth as proof of his demise. Countless Indian villages had been burned; twelve Colonial settlements were completely destroyed and six more heavily damaged. Boston itself very nearly came under attack. In all, 1200 homes were burned, 8000 head of cattle lost, and vast stores of food destroyed. Some sources claim one soldier in ten on both sides was either injured or killed.&#10;&#10;The game's treatment of this broad conflict is simplified. Only a handful of key settlements are named for historical interest while rivers and settlements are placed not so much for geographic and historic accuracy but for ease of play. The forces involved are also necessarily reduced to create a simpler, quicker game. But, taking these factors into account, King Philip&rsquo;s War is as faithful a historical reproduction of the conflict as any quick and simple board game can be. Moreover, KPW&rsquo;s massive destruction, ongoing tension, along with its magnificent art, its singular system of alliances and its unique combat effects die make the game delicious to look at and a real treat to play.

Little bothered by the smattering of slow climbing American P-40 fighters subsequently rushed to the area, high flying Japanese planes raided the Northern Territories an average of four times a month during 1942.&#10;&#10;This changed dramatically in early 1943 when the rapidly expanding RAAF deployed an entire wing of British built Spitfires to Darwin. Led by Australian ace Clive &ldquo;Killer&rdquo; Caldwell, the Spitfires quickly and forcibly confronted the Japanese. At this same time, the RAAF fielded another famous British fighter, the long-range, twin engine Beaufighter. These fast, ten-gun behemoths had an offensive role, ranging far and wide to attack Japanese bases and shipping as far away as Timor, Rabaul and all of New Guinea. Mid-1943 also saw the deployment of the Boomerang to New Guinea. This nimble homegrown fighter, though lacking in air combat ability, proved excellent as a ground support plane.  Thus, whether defending the north, sweeping the seas or bombing bunkers, Australian aircrews and their planes, were a decisive factor in reversing the Japanese fortunes of war in 1943.&#10;&#10;Top Cover No.1: This is the first Fighting Wings game system expansion to be produced.

Most players are herdsman taking their cattle to water, newly married couples and their friends, and housewives in their homes.&#10;&#10;Qelat is usually played in holes in the ground, but wooden boards are also known. The following game was observed by Richard Pankhurst in 1971 who called it Qelat II (Game 5). It might be related to Um el Banat (""game of women""), a mancala game to be found in northern Sudan.&#10;&#10;Rules:&#10;&#10;Qelat is played on a two-row board with six playing holes per row called b&eacute;t in Bil&eacute;n (literally ""house"") and two larger holes at the end of the board to store captured balls. Initially there are four balls in each b&eacute;t. The balls are called til in Bil&eacute;n, if they are dry goat droppings or shesher, if they are small stones.&#10;&#10;The balls are always sown one by one in an anti-clockwise direction.&#10;&#10;If the last ball falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last dropped ball are picked up and continued to be distributed into the following holes.&#10;&#10;The move ends when the last seed falls into an empty hole.&#10;&#10;The players try to capture enemy holes by increasing their contents to four with the last sown ball in any hand. Captured holes are known as ekwarna, literally ""a child is born to me"".&#10;&#10;A move may not start from an ekwarna with the result that balls would tend to accumulate in such holes. A player dropping the last ball in any hand into one of his own ekwarna might say lagadi yekura, literally ""grow up my children!"".&#10;&#10;When the last ball falls into an ekwarna captured by his opponent he would ""eat"" (qunna in Bil&eacute;n) one of the counters in that hole, and put it, together with the ball effecting this capture, aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;A player's ownership of an ekwarna continues even if it becomes empty. Thus balls subsequently entering such a hole, belong to the player who had captured it, while his opponent on dropping the last counter of any lap there would put this counter aside as his takings.&#10;&#10;It is not permitted to pass as long as a player has a legal move.&#10;&#10;The round comes to an end when all the balls are captured either by being put aside or accumulated in ekwarna. The players then count out their total earnings by placing them back in their holes, four counters per hole. Pankhurst reported:&#10;&#10;&#10;        A player who had captured more than his original number of counters would gain one hole from his enemy for every four balls he captured. Should a player have won three extra counters his opponent, who had an extra counter, was obliged to cede to the player with tree who thus acquired an additional hole. If, on the other hand, the two players were each left at the end oft the round with two extra balls they would draw lots to decide to whom they should belong and who in consequence should gain the hole at issue. &#10;&#10;&#10;Eventually, the player who gains a monopoly of all the balls and hence of all twelve holes is declared winner.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,20,5.25,0.0,2

Historical figures tend to be somewhat fickle.&#10;&#10;Figures includes 105 figure cards, with the cards being similar to Innovation cards in that they're divided into ten ages with five colors of cards in each age. Instead of including a dogma power that players can use on their turn, each card in Figures has a karma that changes the game in some way. Karmas might take effect when you meld a card, when you're counting icons to determine whether you can share an action, or when you take some other action in the game. Instead of melding a card, for example, you might score it, or instead of giving cards to opponents who demand from you, you might return cards to the age decks.&#10;&#10;Innovation: Figures in the Sand includes five Decree cards, one for each color.

Brave men and women ally to destroy him &ndash; but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfield, his faithful servant.&#10;&#10;Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfield facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Each player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, incantations, bites and night cards. Five ritual cards &ndash; silver mirror, 2x blood transfusion, holy water and time distortion &ndash; are placed face-up on the table. Renfield creates a ""clock"" by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends.&#10;&#10;Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only incantations, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action, then turns the ritual face-down. Once all five rituals have been used, the hunters win the game, but their main goal is to kill the vampire. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals.&#10;&#10;If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player.

Turenne operated in the northeast of France to join the troops of the Duc de Lorraine and the Spanish with hopes of regaining control of all the fortresses acquired in Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cause.&#10;Sensing the danger of having such a great captain against him, Mazarin entrusted the command of the armies of Flanders and Champagne to the Comte de Plessis-Praslin (meanwhile beginning secret negotiations with the other camp). Plessis-Praslin lay siege to Rethel and, despite having given his word, the governor of Rethel surrendered a few days before Turenne&rsquo;s arrival. The commander of the Frondeur army was therefore required to combat the entire Royalist army.&#10;After his defeat (which would be the last one), Turenne joined the king&rsquo;s camp in exchange for amnesty, a few titles and, most importantly, the command of the French armies. He would be a loyal servant of the king until his death on the battlefield 25 years later.&#10;&#10;&bull; The Dunes 1658 &ndash; 14 June 1658, The alliances had evolved since the end of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. The Lorraine soldiers had gone over to the French camp after their duke was imprisoned by the Spanish. Mazarin convinced King Louis XIV to sign a military alliance with Cromwell who sent a strong English contingency to the continent, thereby forcing King Charles II and Princes James and Henry to join the Spanish with their meagre troops.

Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically.

They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.&#10;&#10;Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.&#10;&#10;Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.&#10;&#10;The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.&#10;&#10;In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.&#10;&#10;In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter ""The Eye of The Zoneplex"" to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.&#10;&#10;",3,5,60,60,5.70556,5.49031,72

If a player is dealt a Kelly card, she places it face up beside her and is dealt another card so that each player has the same number of Friends Cards.&#10;&#10;The presents are turned upside down in the center.

1484,Clue: The Great Museum Caper,1991,"This is a semi-cooperative game which puts the ""thief"" against the rest of the players, who take the role of detectives.  As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.&#10;&#10;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!&#10;&#10;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.  In a tournament style game, each player gets a turn at being the thief, so the number of paintings needed will vary based on the other players' scores.&#10;&#10;1991 Mensa Select&#10;&#10;Also selected by Family Fun Magazine as one of the best games.&#10;&#10;Original name by inventors was Heist.

Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.&#10;&#10;Game 2&#10;&#10;Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.&#10;&#10;Game 3&#10;&#10;All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.&#10;&#10;",2,6,20,20,4.94336,5.46919,107

These goals interact in interesting ways - for example, to get roof points you want a very high castle, but most residents prefer relatively low levels of the castle.&#10;&#10;Normally you place one tile each round, but if you place a colored toy block next to another colored toy block you get to place one extra tile on your turn. This can be used to take tiles from the shared stock in quick succession or to make a surprise play.&#10;&#10;Once someone has played their 15th tile, play continues until everyone has had the same number of turns before entering final scoring.

36291,"USAAF: US Strategic Bombing Operations Over the Third Reich, 1944",2008,"Best estimates today have it that the war in Europe most likely would have continued for about 24 months after February 1944 had it not been for the cumulative effects of the Allied strategic aerial offensive against the Germans. That means the war was most likely shortened somewhere between 13 and 15 months by the effects of that campaign. We say ""most likely"" and ""somewhere between"" because we can't be more certain. That is, starting at the end of 1944, the Western Allied and Soviet ground advances began to add their resource-denying effects to the successes being scored by the bombers. Where precisely the effects of the one effort picked up and the other left off is, and will likely always remain, a matter of debate.&#10;&#10;We can, however, use that December 1944 cut off date to our advantage in this game. We know for certain that prior to that time any collapse of the German war effort would mostly certainly have been due to the bombings' effects. If the ""Bomber Barons"" were to prove they could win a war with their planes alone, we can now see they had to do it by that date. Thus the would-be Bomber Barons in today's wargame hobby must also bring their efforts to fruition by that time in the game in order to win.&#10;&#10;In general, each ""game turn"" represents the cumulative effects of one month of aerial operations. Note, though, Game Turn 3 represents two calendar months. That's because a large portion of US aircraft strength was drawn away from this campaign during that time in order to assist in the battlefield preparation for the D-Day landings. There are a maximum of 10 game turns to each campaign.&#10;&#10;The large-size, fully iconic, counters included with the game (176 total), are by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi. They represent air groups and wings, along with German FLAK brigades and divisions. Aside from all the formations historically involved in the campaign, an extended German Me-262 order of battle is included. That will allows players to determine, once and for all, exactly how many of those remarkable planes it would've taken to have finally and fully stopped the American onslaught.&#10;&#10;Each large hex on the map represents 33.33 miles (54 Km) from side to opposite side.

133969,Regular Season Basketball,2011,"REGULAR SEASON BASKETBALL is a statistical based tabletop game that allows you to recreate NBA games alone, quickly and in a very realistic way, by using two six-sided dice of different colors (a dark one and a white one) and two team charts. A ruler can also be useful if you want. You are not the coach, but a spectator which attends the game and watches its development and the stats accumulating in a very realistic manner.&#10;There is a BASIC GAME, very simple and fast to play, and an ADVANCED GAME, which allows you to choose the statistical detail you desire, by giving you the possibility to keep track of minutes played by each player, blocks, steals, disqualifications, team possessions and the chance to use special playoffs rules. You should have more time to play if you desire more detail, but after learning the very simple mechanism, you will be able to play an entire game in about 30 minutes while keeping every kind of individual stats. Regular Season Basketball is ideal to replay a whole season, since actual games played by each player are also recreated by consulting the &ldquo;Rest Chart&rdquo; at the beginning of the game. So, no boring dice rolls before the game just to determine which player will play, no setup time involved; players will populate the scoresheet as soon as they are called in action by the chart. Also do not ask about how to resolve the opening tip-off. This is a segment by segment game, not a possessions game.&#10;&#10;Every single game is played through several segments, each one representing three minutes of real play. In each segment, both teams roll two dice once to determine scores and stats; after four segments a quarter of 12 minutes will be over. To complete an NBA game, 16 dice rolls are required by each team. For an NCAA game the time scale is different with each die roll representing four minutes and 10 total rolls necessary to complete a game. When a tie game occurs, an overtime is played by rolling the dice once more for each team, this being the only case in which a segment represents five minutes instead of three.&#10;&#10;You will never lose the feeling of the game because alternating the dice rolls between the two teams you have the score for each three minutes of play, catching the drama of a close game, realizing ""garbage time"" situations, big come-backs and the influence of the home court advantage very strong specially in the final minutes of a game.&#10;&#10;",1,2,30,30,8.19286,0.0,14

141054,Ultrium Sphere: Sub'Primal Sphere,2012,"In a distant future, man has conquered space and the ultimate entertainment is an extremely violent sport called ULTRIUM SPHERE.&#10;&#10;In these matches, anything goes. At least two teams oppose each other, competing to score the 3 decisive goals that lead to victory. The teams usually belong to powerful corporations or mere independents, and the players come from the entire Galaxy (human beings, androids, genetic experiments or aliens). ULTRIUM SPHERE has become the most popular game throughout the universe and is watched by hundreds of billions of entities. The players who manage to survive the game and perform outstandingly well are virtually elevated to the rank of Divinities and are named the ULTRAs. &#10; In ULTRIUM SPHERE, each player is the leader of an Ultrium Sphere team, which he/she tries to lead to victory.&#10;Each team consists of two decks:  25 Ultra Cards and 25 Interaction Cards. The Ultra Cards represent the team members and describe their race and various characteristics, offensive (tackling, attack, shot) and defensive (resistance, save, pass). The Interaction cards are the different strategies that the team can apply. &#10;At the beginning of the game, each player draws 4 Interaction Cards and 6 Ultra Cards. The 6 Ultras are to be laid out in two lines, the attack line and the defense line (3 Ultras in each line). The Interaction cards stay in hand. &#10;The Ultras can be used either for their special ability or to carry out various actions according to their place on the field. The strikers can undermine the opponent&rsquo;s defense (tackling, attack) or try to shoot a goal. The defenders can make passes to strikers (a pass must take place prior to every shot at goal) or stop the opponent&rsquo;s shots. The player must activate the Ultras (i.e. turn them at a 90-degree angle) when he/she uses them. Once activated, the Ultras can no longer be used. Therefore, the player must not activate all his/her Ultras during his/her turn, since the activated Ultras will not be able to defend during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. When the player chooses to play an action, he/she must cast a 12-sided die and add the Ultra&rsquo;s personal bonus for the action chosen. To know whether the action succeeds or not, the player compares the total to a success threshold, which must be exceeded or not depending on the type of action.&#10;The Interaction card may be used at any time to strengthen one&rsquo;s own Ultras or weaken the opponent&rsquo;s Ultras. &#10;When the turn begins, the player draws 1 Interaction card and set all his/her Ultras upright. First, he/she can replace Ultras and have 2 Ultras swap place. He/she can then use the Ultras and Interaction cards.&#10;When the player can no longer or does no longer want to carry out any action, or when he/she scores a goal, his/her turn ends and the opponent can begin his/her turn.&#10;The game goes on until one of the players scores 3 goals.&#10;&#10;",2,0,15,15,6.57143,0.0,7

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.&#10;&#10;The game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as ""Improved Bridge Building Techniques"" that allow players to build across estuaries or ""Sheep Boom Goes Bust"" which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.&#10;&#10;During the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.&#10;&#10;If all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.&#10;&#10;",2,5,180,180,6.44179,5.59855,262

The trick in the game is that you can move on the paths over the tiles, then move on the paths underneath the tiles, then move again on the surface.&#10;&#10;There are two kinds of tile. One tile has the right angle paths in the same place on both sides. The other tile has them on different places on each side. This works because you can tell by the markings which paths are on the underside without having to look. The board is set up randomly in a 5x7 grid.&#10;&#10;When travelling underneath, you must travelling under at least one stone on the surface, of either player. If you do go under an opponent's stone, you are allowed a further tile rotation at the end of your move (a key bonus that gives you an edge). You are not allowed to move a tile that your opponent just turned, but otherwise you can rotate any tile at all.&#10;&#10;The new edition by Abacus is in card, with little wood posts to help lift and turn the tiles. The first edition is a nice wooden edition, part of a range of games by the firm Clemens Gerhards.&#10;&#10;Moguli seems like a brain-burner at first, but quickly the possibilities become obvious, and as only a few tiles move, you can read the paths on both sides very easily. You move from trying to figure the board, to trying to figure your opponent's options and how to exploit them. Moguli is a very interesting abstract that seems gimmicky at first, but soon becomes a clever challenge and very entertaining.&#10;&#10;",2,2,45,45,6.28839,5.51834,56

Oids cannot move onto or past other Oids.&#10;&#10;Breeding: if the player's Oids have eaten six tiles, they breed.

Centerville abstractly models the growth and management of a small city &mdash; perhaps not unlike the one you're in right now.&#10;&#10;Players act as entrepreneurs, tycoons, politicians, and other local movers and shakers working to develop a modern urban area. Fortunes will be made and fame will rise. As time goes by, personal milestones will enrich the players even further.&#10;&#10;Throughout the game, players will roll six dice, keeping some and rerolling others, then implementing the various die faces on the game board. This will result in political offices being gained and lost, new vocations learned, new land acquired, or new buildings constructed. The end result is a vibrant community revered near and wide &mdash; but only the player who has best balanced their wealth and prestige will emerge the final victor.&#10;&#10;Playing time is 15-20 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;",2,4,40,80,6.91806,5.86997,746
177322,VERBA: Español Core Set,2015,"VERBA is the new language learning card game developed by The Pericles Group. The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.&#10;&#10;All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.&#10;&#10;This is a core set specially tailored for novice level Spanish learners and works great in or out of the classroom!&#10;&#10;",3,10,15,30,5.0,0.0,2

Example: with PAT, you could name sPAT, PArT, sePAraTe, etc.  Then the score is the sum of the cards' values time the number of words stated.

32478,The Finnish Trilogy 1939-1945: Continuation War 1941-1944 (vol. 2),2014,"(from Mikugames website:)&#10;&#10;Germany launched their operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 22nd, 1941. Finland, now a co-belligerent with Germany, took the opportunity to take back the areas lost to the Soviet Union as part of the bitter Winter War peace terms. The almost 200.000 men strong German &ldquo;Armee Norwegen&rdquo;, operating in northern Finland is part of Hitler&rsquo;s operation plan Barbarossa. Finland and Germany are fighting two separate wars against the same enemy. Finnish units reached their objectives in late December, 1941, and a static period in the war began (also called the &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo;). In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army launched a major offensive in the Karelian Isthmus after the withdrawal of the German &ldquo;Heeresgruppe Nord&rdquo; from the Leningrad area. This time the Finnish units couldn&rsquo;t hold back the thrust. Viipuri (Vyborg) was lost and the situation was critical. The largest battle in the Northern Europe took place in Tali-Ihantala, where German Stukas supported the Finnish units. Like a miracle, the Finns and Germans managed to halt the Soviet onslaught, and because Stalin was eager to reach Berlin before the Americans, he decided to withdraw a number of units from the Finnish front. Finland was again saved by the bell.&#10;&#10;The Game&#10;The second game of the trilogy is the largest. Now the Germans make an entrance with a wide variety of units and special rules. The Soviet side gets the Guards units as well as numerous of new air unit types. The grande campaign 1941-1944, can take up to 155 turns! Relax, in the middle of the campaign, approximately from Jan. I '42 to Jun. I '44, there will be a special feature, called the Position War (Entrenchment War), which will speed up the playing considerably.&#10;&#10;There are also two shorter scenarios included, that suites very well for introduction; the 1941-scenario (Jun. IV '41 &ndash; Dec. IV '41 = 26 turns) and the 1944-scenario (Jun. II '44 &ndash; Sept. I '44 = 12 turns). In the 1941-scenario, the Finnish/German side has an advantage, while in the 1944-scenario, the Soviet side has an advantage.&#10;&#10;Unit Counters&#10;The game will include twelve countersheets in a total of 3.192 die-cut unit counters! Ground units are written in standard Nato symbols, while Air and Naval units have correct silhouettes.&#10;&#10;The Mapboard&#10;The map will be 100 cm x 140 cm (39&rdquo; x 55&rdquo;) in four pieces, depicting Finland and its' vicinity in ""summer"" colors with additional Railroads and Airfields as well as some new Marker boxes.

Along with these disks, and the regiments they can form, come new rules for Poison and the powerful keywords, Guard X and Stalwart.&#10;&#10;Units with Poison assign poison tokens to their foes whenever they deal damage in melee or with their ranged attacks. These poison tokens then cause the target's wounds to fester, preventing it from clearing its damage tokens in the end phase, as well as limiting the effect of any healing or restorative magic.&#10;&#10;Guard X is the opposite of Impact X, and a unit with Guard X deals X damage to each enemy disks that pin it after a flip.&#10;&#10;Stalwart allows units to activate to perform ranged attacks or activate focus abilities even while they&rsquo;re pinned. It's truly difficult to keep a Stalwart unit pinned for long!&#10;&#10;Still, it's the Dwarfs that are the true stars of Hammer and Hold, and the expansion comes with enough Dwarf heroes and units to muster three full regiments.

122186,Albert's Insomnia,2010,"Rules of the Game:&#10;&#10;4 cards are dealt for all players to see, two of which have yellow backs. The first player uses as many or as few cards as needed, (the only rule is each card can only be used once per turn) to create an equation that equals 1. The next player uses the same cards to create an equation for 2 and play continues as high as cards or ability allows. The player that finds the highest consecutive operation wins!&#10;&#10;Publisher Blurb:&#10;&#10;Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game using math operations, which can be differentiated for all grades, inclusive of K-5, 6-8 and even high school level students (when factorials and exponents are incorporated into the game).  Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is easily differentiated, it provides the teacher or parent with flexibility to adjust the game to each student&rsquo;s level.  A teacher can easily raise or lower the ability level of the game by choosing different numbers with which the student(s) can work.  It allows for individual use, small group and whole class learning experiences.  The game can teach students in small groups and as a whole class to work collaboratively and cooperatively, encouraging team work within the classroom.&#10;&#10;Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game, it gives students the opportunity to think and solve equations in order to achieve success in the game.  Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is not a game where students methodically repeat drills in order to learn their math facts.  Students naturally acquire this ability through the different processes needed in order to complete the solutions.  Students are able to first visualize the numerical operation by the number on the face of the card, then by referring to the different operation signs (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  The game can also allow for tactile bodily/kinesthetic engagement as students move the cards or touch the cards while working through their solutions.  Students inherently begin to acquire the knowledge of multiplication and division through their repetitive use of the numbers to consecutively count the sheep in the game.  When students achieve a solution, they reinforce their newly acquired skills and the other students participating in the game also hear the repetition of the mathematical equation, which provides reinforcement of the necessary math skills needed for students to be successful in math.&#10;&#10;Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia appeals to students because it is purposely sized to fit in small hands.  It does not have the look or feel of flashcards, allowing students to feel like they are always playing a game instead of doing school or homework.  But because they are instantly and continuously engaged, they are learning while having fun.  The developers purposely designed the game so students never feel as though they are going through math drills, and as students achieve their goals to win the game, the teacher or parent wins because the students have learned and practiced their math facts and order of operations while playing the game.  Even reluctant math students get hooked on Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia because each hand begins very easily, and players are fully involved in &ldquo;playing a game&rdquo; before the more challenging aspects of math kick in.

Deserted and inhospitable. Wildly controlled by the elements. Life has no place here...&#10;&#10;But you came! With your divine powers. You know, or more precisely, you want to turn Myraclia...to a dreamed planet full of life. The task is not easy. You have to subdue chaotic elements of nature, organize them, establish order, to give life a chance...&#10;&#10;But you are not alone. Others want to turn Myraclia into their picture. Resources and time are limited. If you want to think of Myraclia as your creation, you have to fight with others ruthlessly for resources, but the form of Myraclia as well.&#10;&#10;Your goals are noble. But are your motives?&#10;&#10;- - -&#10;&#10;THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GAME&#10;&#10;In the game, you compete with other players for the title of The Creator of Myraclia. You are trying to get limited and chaotically emerging elements and sources of life. These are represented by glittering cubes in 7 colors in uneven numbers. You have to get them, organize them correctly, possibly replace them with the other player's elements, and ..... a miracle! The desolate and inhospitable part of Myraclia changes into a beautiful cradle of life.&#10;&#10;The Myraclia surface is divided into hexagonal tiles. One side of the tile represents the original look of Myraclia, before the transformation, without life, the other side of the terraformed appearance, the new beautiful face of Myraclia full of greenery. There are 4 types of surfaces, namely plains, forests, water areas, and mountains.&#10;&#10;The game takes place in rounds, divided into two basic phases.&#10;&#10;In the first &ndash; drafting phase &ndash; players alternate in the specified order and select one element (cube) from the drafting board to help them transform (re-shape) a part of the planet in the next phase. But remember. Not the same resources are available in each round. Those elements, which were abundant in the last round and nobody wanted them, can now be scarce and desirable. And vice versa. The price for gaining a rare element is great. Speed - and sometimes greed &ndash; during elements selection determine the player order for an important second phase.&#10;&#10;In the second phase - the terraformation - the players, according to the order set in the first phase, turn the individual deserted parts of the planet into Myraclia full of life. They discard the elements displayed on the Myraclia tile and turn it to a terraformed side. In most parts, they instantly earn points and/or a bonus in the form of the free released element. A released element can be used immediately. Order is key, but the first position does not necessarily mean an absolute advantage. If you were greedy in the first phase or you have chosen the wrong combination of elements, other players in turn could exchange their elements for your unused elements. The reward for the conversion of Myraclia is, in addition to the points, also the right to reveal new parts of the planet (by choosing new Myraclia tiles from the offer).&#10;&#10;The game ends in a round in which any player has terraformed 7 parts of Myraclia planet or if a certain part of the planet has been terraformed (i.e. it is not possible to replenish the offer of Myraclia tiles).&#10;&#10;Until the last moment, you cannot be sure who gets the title of The Creator of Myraclia.&#10;&#10;At final scoring, players are rewarded by the final look of the planet Myraclia and receive a bonus for the most consecutive terraformed area of the planet, for the variety of the terraformed surface, but also for the size of individual types of surfaces terraformed by the player.&#10;&#10;Your reward is a brand new Myraclia, beautiful, full of life. And also the feeling that you have contributed to it ..... the most.&#10;&#10;",2,5,45,55,7.2022,5.56769,100

War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.&#10;&#10;Indian Empires is a complete game, using the same game engine as Soldier Emperor, our strategic game of the Napoleonic Wars. It can be played separately, or together with Soldier Emperor; our Dreams of Empire book includes a linking map and the rules and pieces for its use.&#10;&#10;Indian Empires is a new edition of our long out-of print Soldier Raj. It includes over a dozen scenarios from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the ""sepoy general"" who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.&#10;&#10;The playing pieces are decadently thick tiles; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are original works of art by Terry Moore Strickland. As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory.&#10;&#10;As in Soldier Emperor, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.&#10;&#10;Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.&#10;&#10;",1,5,120,240,7.7,0.0,5

Each Forgery Card matches each of the Art Cards.&#10;&#10;Eight Art Cards are then chosen randomly and players look at all of them before the game begins so that a strategy can be considered. The eight Art Cards are then shuffled and put into a pile called the Catalog. Each player then gets ten Money Cards.&#10;&#10;Play is done in rounds. For each round, the top Art Card from the Catalog is revealed and players make an initial bid. Players can then increase their bids until a winner for the round is determined. Special Cards can also be played during the round. Rounds continue until each Art Card is revealed and bid upon.&#10;&#10;The challenge of the game is to win high priced artworks without running out of money or taking in a forgery.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the Forgery Cards are revealed and their matching Art Cards are eliminated. Players then count up the values of the Art Cards they possess. The player with the highest value of art is the winner.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",2,8,0,0,0.0,0.0,0

It is intended both for hobby play and for use in professional education about humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.&#10;&#10;The game is set in the fictional country of Carana, but is loosely modeled on disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It explores approximately three months of humanitarian operations, including both the initial emergency and a later period of early recovery. Because Carana is a fragile, conflict- affected country, relief and reconstruction efforts may also involve issues of social unrest and political instability, especially during the early recovery stage once the initial shock of the crisis has worn off.&#10;&#10;The primary objective of all players is to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the local population (thereby scoring ""relief points""). However, players also need to maintain public and political support for their organizations (""operations points""), whether to govern (Carana), sustain the relief mission (HADR-TF), or secure financial support (UN and NGOs).&#10;&#10;""At-Risk"" cards indicate the current emergency needs for food, water/sanitation, medical, or shelter supplies in each district of the capital. Players must bring the necessary supplies into the country, and allocate aid teams to deliver them in time. Aid teams might also be engaged in rescue operations, aid coordination, needs assessment, infrastructure repair, public relations or other key tasks. Event cards inject many of the numerous challenges associated with relief operations into game play, but also indicate the self-help efforts of the local population as they struggle to survive and recover.&#10;&#10;Game play is cooperative, but it is possible for some, all, or no player to win.&#10;&#10;",4,4,120,120,7.87963,0.0,27

1634,Warhammer Quest,1995,"Warhammer Quest is the original game in the Warhammer Quest Series.&#10;&#10;From the Main Rulebook:&#10;&#10;In Warhammer Quest each player takes the role of a warrior, one of four brave adventurers willing to test their courage in the search for wealth and glory. Each hero comes from a different people. The Barbarian has traveled far from the savage north, a land of bitter cold and ferocious warriors. The Wizard hails from the cities of the Empire, the largest and most important of the realms of men. The Dwarf is drawn by the goldlust for which his race is famous. Dwarfs are grim and rather abrupt, but they are good fighters and loyal friends who remember debts of gratitude as readily as debts of coin. The Elf comes from the green woods of Loren where his kin spend their days hunting and making merry, protected from evil by the strange magic of their land. Elves are incredibly quick and agile, and they are also the best archers in the world.&#10;&#10;In the Warhammer Quest game the players enter a dark and forbidding dungeon. Together they must face the horrific dangers that wait for them. They will be attacked by monsters such as Orcs, Goblins, Skaven and Minotaurs. Other perils lurk in the darkness: scurrying venomous things like spiders, deadly pit traps, and decayed tunnels that cave in at the slightest touch. If they complete their quest the players will be rewarded with gold, treasure and artefacts of magical power. The more gold and treasure you can discover the better.., and the player whose warrior amasses the greatest fortune has done best of all!&#10;&#10;Warhammer Quest is probably unlike other games you have played. Rather than each player competing against the others, all the players must co-operate if they are to win. Also, there is no single board. Instead, the different rooms and corridor sections are clipped together to make a dungeon that is different every time you play. The game rules may seem a little complex at first - but don't worry a lot of the rules are designed to extend the game and are not vital to begin with. The actual game rules you need to play are in this book or printed on the various cards.

Dice are rolled to see if he is listening.  If he is not listening you roll to see what direction he is going to run.  Then dice are rolled to see how far your Dunger runs that turn.  Running into walls and boulders knocks your Dunger out but knocks some sense into them letting you control their movement better when they wake up.

Moreover ""Faction"" means that the product format is sold according to the different kingdoms or factions. New expansion sets come in new boxes containing FULL PLAYSET (not only 1-2 copies) of new cards for its corresponding faction or an alliance of 2 kingdoms. So, it's not necessary acquiring the full expansion if only an specific kingdom is wanted.&#10;&#10;If you like classic Card Games mechanics but want something really NEW, and a true new strategic component which will make you develop your strategies at a higher level, this is your game.&#10;&#10;Both players start with 20 life points, and our goal is reducing opponent's life to 0 or below. But to achieve that we need to cast our troops in our invocation line (first line)and cross with them all the battlefield, fighting enemy troops to reach their lines and ""hit"" them equal to our troops ATK value. As said, 20 points means victory. The fact troops need to move makes them have an unusual basic value: they have ATTACK/LIFE and SPEED (number of zones -cells- they can run in a turn).&#10;&#10;But troops, objects and the rest of cards aren't played for free. It's fundamental to produce mana and gold for that. With this purpose, we will build ""Place"" cards with a cost and production amount. So, each turn we will add mana and gold equal to 1 plus the production indicated by our place cards. A good curve in resources production means a good match development, and that will make us stronger.&#10;&#10;Important: place cards are separated from ""battle cards"" (the rest: troops, objects, spells...), for us to choose what we want to draw each turn.&#10;&#10;In a players' phase, they prepare all ""turned"" (exhausted) cards, add resources, build places, invoke troops or forge objects, then go to tactical phase, in which they can move troops one by one, cast spells, play hero skills, equip objects, fight against enemy troops or hit enemy player.&#10;&#10;Sudden spells can be also played in response to opponent's actions, in order to disable their strategy.&#10;&#10;A 1vs1 game which would charm any card+strategy game lover.&#10;&#10;We summarize it with a single sentence: &#10;END OF GAME.

1780,Knights of Camelot,1980,"Knights of Camelot ranks right alongside Divine Right; it is an early TSR game brimming with flavour.&#10;&#10;The players are freshly knighted and wander the Arthurian realm looking for damsels in distress, brigands, monsters, other knights to joust with, etc. The game uses a random table generation driver that can lead to an enormous variety of encounters. I remember fondly two incidents:&#10;&#10;In the first, a knight met a Dwarf on a horse. Deciding to approach and meet him (instead of avoiding or charging), the dwarf turned out to be a knight in disguise&mdash;but not just any knight! It was Lancelot, the foremost knight of the realm! We had a sudden vision of the hollowed-out horse necessary to hide Lancelot's bulk&hellip;&#10;&#10;In another incident, a player led a charmed life and pulled ahead of the others in their quest for the Holy Grail. He met Merlin repeatedly and ended up with a special charger, magic lance, and magic shield&mdash;the works! England wasn't much of a challenge for him any more, so he decided to cross the Channel to France. Bad move! His ship sank in a storm so he washed up on the shore minus all his equipment and followers. Dejected, he trudged to the nearest castle to ask for help&mdash;but a giant jumped out of the moat and killed him in one blow!&#10;&#10;The game has heavy role-playing elements to it; articles in Dragon Magazine, Issue# 58 explained how one could play knaves (bad knights), and GMs have been known to use the game as an adventure generator for RPGs.&#10;&#10;",2,6,120,240,6.536,5.5629,175

The player has to carry out one of four missions, or string all four together in a campaign game.&#10;&#10;LRDG uses the Commando series rules. Each mission card grants the player a specified number of operations points to reach certain objectives. Operations points are expended to recruit the special ops team, then to move and attack on the map. A deck of event cards controls the opposition forces (OPFOR). Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical system with opposing units taking turns firing at one another. Victory can increase the number of operations points available, but heavy losses can reduce them.

Unfortunately, the neighbors are often prepared with weapons (including shotguns, holy water, machetes, stakes, and more). The game's art is humorous, parodying pop-horror icons from TV and movies (e.g. Buffy, Star Trek, Dawn of the Dead, etc).&#10;&#10;Game-play: On your turn, you can attack any other player with a monster card. If the defending player has a matching weapon, they equip that weapon by placing it under a living family member card and remain safe. For instance, if you attacked with ""hell mutt"" (a demon) and they equip ""holy water"" (an anti-demon weapon), they're safe.  Otherwise, the defender must choose one of their family members to perish. Flip that card over, revealing a gravestone.&#10;&#10;If you can't or don't attack, you may play an action card or discard to refresh your hand. At the end of your turn, you refill your hand to 4 cards.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to win: 1) kill all your neighbors; 2) equip your family with all 4 kinds (suits) of weapon.&#10;&#10;",2,5,20,20,5.25,0.0,4

One player takes the role of the nursing staff, who move around getting treatments (pills, injections, and electroshock devices), administering treatments, waking up sleeping patients, and moving patients from room to room. However, they do not have free choice when moving the nurses; for each one a die is rolled, giving two possible rooms they can go to.&#10;&#10;The traumatosaure player moves the traumatosaures that have appeared in the hospital (because the matching patients fell asleep) and moves them, also using die rolls, which now determine how far to move (half speed if the patient is now awake).

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;OtherPart of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in ""bad stuff"" which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the ""big announcement."" Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

To secure your prize permanently, take the merchant ship to Black Bart's Lagoon.  Be careful to avoid other pirates, as they can steal the ship before you get to Black Bart's Lagoon.  The lagoon, along with the tavern, fortress, and port, are all special hex tiles that serve different purposes in the game.  As you roam the seas, watch out for the navy!

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The Universal Fighting System (UFS) is a collectible card game originally designed by Sabertooth Games. The themes of the cards are drawn from a multitude of licensed gaming universes, especially fighting game licenses.&#10;&#10;A game in the Universal Fighting System represents a battle between two adversaries. Each player controls one of the two characters, with the objective being to defeat the opponent, typically through loss of vitality. The two characters need not be from the same universe; for example, Chun-Li from Street Fighter could battle Cassandra from Soul Calibur or Tycho from Penny Arcade.&#10;&#10;Players take turns, with each turn consisting of multiple actions. With each additional action a player takes in a turn, the difficulty of successfully completing that action increases. Players can continue to take actions until they choose to stop or until they fail an attempt. The game structure typically involve players building up foundations over successive turns, which then allows a greater number of actions before failure. Management of these becomes crucial, as players must strike a balance between using their resources for offense and defense; going ""all out"" for a series of attacks can leave one vulnerable to retaliation during the opponent's turn. The system relies heavily on card combinations, where one card enhances the effect of another. The game is an advanced or expert level product (owing in large part to the fact that every card has at least one special ability), primarily aimed at older or more experienced gamers.&#10;&#10;In July 2023, publisher Jasco Games announced that UFS would be renamed UniVersus, with the publisher simultaneously changing its name to UVS Games, with ""UVS"" being short for UniVersus.&#10;&#10;",2,2,10,30,6.94,0.0,20

The game is played in a sequence of turns, with each turn allowing a player to perform 1 Main Action and any number of Free Actions. As a Main Action, a player will usually place a worker on an Action Space.&#10;&#10;The workers (collectively known as Vassals) come in two types: Spearmen &ndash; young warriors of each house, and Dragonriders &ndash; noble warriors and hunters gifted with their own Simurgh steed.

This launches the ball up and onto the playing field. Falling into one of four large oblong holes around the pitcher's mound is a strike. Dropping into the round hole near each fielder  is an out. Dropping into any of the numbered holes is a safe hit of that many bases. There is a home run hole in deep center field. If a launched ball fails to fall into any of the holes, it is a ball.

In those times between these two countries there at peace, but there were a lot of border disputes which eventually caused a battle to be fought. Those are simulated in this game.&#10; The players should build armies in their castles, improve their current defenses and collect taxes from villages, while trying to work against the enemy opponent.&#10; Battles are one of the unique features that this game has. When you have a battle you take the ""battle"" map, and place your army there. On the strategic map you only have one counter, which shows only the name of the army, but you have to administrate, what kind of troops that army consists of (250 Hussars, 85 Infantry...etc). On the battle map you take the corresponding counters, and play battles with them, writing down casualties. Every unit has different fighting/moving values. The sieges are also great! Another map is used (there are about 6 different castles), and modified by the defenses you have built since the start of the game. It also has some extra rules, which make sieges fun. (for example when you go for a siege, you have to decide how much grain you will bring with you)&#10;&#10;The good side of the game is that the Hungarian and the Turkish sides really differ from each other, and need completely different playing styles.&#10;&#10;Of course, the game has a downside. The amount of administration needed to play might cause the casual player to never sit down and play a game.&#10;&#10;This game is great in Hungarian history, and shows those times, which were so full with death, battles and instability.&#10;&#10;",2,6,180,180,5.5,0.0,4

When the raft moves onto a whirlpool, it must stop there.  The active player receives a Navigational Certificate and changes the direction of the whirlpool's arrows and its color.  Aside from these certificates, players can receive Duty cards if they land the raft on an arrow that is connected to the Duty tiles placed on the board.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the raft reaches the island of Raroio.  The players sum up the points given for their Navigation Certificates and sets of Duty cards.  The winner is the one with the most points.&#10;&#10;",2,4,15,15,5.64286,0.0,21

The Freeblade Knight once known as the Living Litany is an unfortunate example; nobody knows what truly happened to this once-valiant hero, only that it has renamed itself Litany of Destruction, and has been leaving a brutal trail of devastation in its wake.

Every game turn is split into two phases- the plan phase and the execute phase. In the plan phase, each player secretly writes down what actions they intend to perform in the execute phase, consulting the action table. Each action has an action point cost with a budget of 3 per turn. When each player has worked out what they intend to do, they move on the execute phase and reveal their actions. Each player carries out their elected actions in the order they appear on the action table. if both players choose the same action, you roll off to see who goes first. The more powerful or useful an action is, the later that actions comes in the order of play, so choose your knight's actions wisely. The goal of each game varies with the scenario chosen and can range from total elimination to reaching an important objective on the board.&#10;&#10;Imperial Knights: Renegade is a game of bluff and feint, outwitting your opponent, making clever use of terrain, movement and ion shields to secure victory.

It should be easy for Prince Charming to defeat a young boy, except that Hansel has an equally sinister sister, Gretel, and together they form an eerily unstoppable duo. It will take all of their tricks to win control of the Kingdom, but who will be victorious?""&#10;&#10;The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.&#10;&#10;Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,20,5.78833,5.50303,60

Achievus game includes 112 Cards, 4 Conscious/Subconscious Mind Boards, 4 Golden Rule Applied Tokens, 60 PMA Point Tokens, 44 Opportunity Time Tokens, 2 Token Bags, and the rules for both original and junior game variations.&#10;&#10;Achievus Junior &ndash; Game Play Overview&#10;&#10;While playing Achievus Junior each player takes a turn in clockwise order to complete a round of play. A player takes his or her turn by following these 5 steps;&#10;&#10;Step 1) Draw Step - Draw up to 6 cards, if needed.&#10;Step 2) Call Step - Call out a card to a player for a possible match.&#10;Step 3) Give & Take Step - Give and Take a card with a player.&#10;Step 4) Play Step - May play down any needed pairs for the player&rsquo;s collection of the 17 principles,&#10;Step 5) Redraw Step - Redraw up to 6 cards.&#10;&#10;If the players don&rsquo;t have a match during Step 2 then the calling player will lose one of his 11 Opportunity Time Tokens. When it&rsquo;s a match both players add the needed principle card to his or her collection of 17 principle cards. Then they read the principle meaning from the card aloud and discuss it with their alliance. The goal of Achievus Junior is for each player to help one another to collect a card of all 17 principles, without losing all of his or her Opportunity Time Tokens. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.&#10;&#10;Achievus Original &ndash; Game Play Overview&#10;&#10;While Playing Achievus Original, players will experience prosperity and adversity events throughout the game, earning PMA points and Action Stars. All players&rsquo; follow these 6 consecutive steps together, each step before the next, to complete a round of play.&#10;&#10;Step 1) Draw Step - Each player draws five cards, resolving any adversity or prosperity events.&#10;Step 2) Sacrifice Step - Each player may or may not choose to sacrifice his turn, discarding his cards and losing only one Opportunity Time Token this way.&#10;Step 3) Collect Step - Each player may choose to collect the cards they have previously played in their Conscious Mind Section to earn PMA points and Action Stars or may choose to continue gathering without collecting at this time. &#10;Step 4) Play Step - Each player plays his or her cards in consecutive order in any players&rsquo; Conscious Mind Section, earning PMA points for giving.&#10;Step 5) Missed Opportunity Step - Each player loses one of his or her 11 Opportunity Time Tokens for each principle card not played then discards them.&#10;Step 6) Read Step &ndash; Read the top discarded principle card. Players then share aloud how they have applied this principle in his or her life with their alliance.&#10;&#10;The goal of Achievus Original is to strategize among the alliance to make the best possible plays. Players need to prepare for Adversity Events that may take away the Principle Cards in a player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. Players work together to gather all 17 Principle Cards in one player&rsquo;s Conscious Mind Section. When this is accomplished, that player collects the cards (During Step 3) which includes all 17 principle cards. Only then will the players earn the Golden Rule Applied Tokens, the ultimate achievement of the game.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,90,0.0,0.0,0
2644,Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,1987,"Based on the movie, this game's object is to discover your opponents' identities, find the Will and return to your home space.&#10;&#10;On your move, you roll two dice (black and white); you move as indicated by the white die (1-6), adding the black die (1-3) if you choose to.  Movement around the board can be accelerated by the Trolley or by Benny the taxi cab (each uses his own special die to move, which boils down to a 1 in 6 chance of stopping --this mechanic pervades the game as you'll see).&#10;&#10;Identities can be guessed by looking at cards set up on the board; each shows half a character's picture, in a player colour.  Once you've seen both halves of a given colour, you're allowed to guess that character as that player's identity.  Each correct guess allows a search for the Will, checking the Confidential cards that lie on the Dip Cannon circle.  Once a player has grabbed the Will, the others go after him and forget about identity-guessing.&#10;&#10;You can steal the Will by Dip Cannonning the Will-holder, by sending a Weasel after him or by landing on him by exact count.  To use th Dip Cannon, you use your (one and only) Dip Cannon card or one of the Judge Doom cards you've previously found, then roll the Dip Cannon die.  Each ""Dip"" rolled turns the cannon one space towards your target; the ""cancel dip"" die face stops the process altogether.  If you successfully Dip him, he drops the Will and is sent back to any home space.  Weasels work in similar fashion, the Weasel token starting beside your token and moving towards its quarry with each successful weasel die throw.  Used Weasel cards may be recovered by landing on a special space in the Dip Cannon circle.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,60,5.06429,0.0,21

Every model in the DC Universe Miniature Games is supplied with a character card, which tracks a model's actions and health during a game.

If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.&#10;     Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up going last in the next.&#10;     Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act have done so.&#10;     Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.&#10;&#10;&#10;Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.&#10;&#10;",2,4,60,90,6.1,0.0,10

The Challenge (5) and Item (8) cards are spread face up to serve as reference cards.  There are two playable characters and three ""bad guys"".&#10;&#10;To move, the die is rolled and the hero's Speed factor added in.  Items collected add to the Speed, Luck or Strength factors.  A hero can only carry what the figure can actually carry --two hands, maybe a backpack with a loop on its side.  Once the Scorpion Palace (or the Elephant) is reached, challenges are faced.  You choose which factor to use, although some items mean you win the challenge automatically (most items just give a bonus).  A die is added (re-roll Hooks); if your total is less than the Challenge rating, you lose an item and must try again later.  Once a Challenge is defeated, it is cleared for all players.&#10;&#10;Outside the Palace, when you roll a Hook then the bad guy Sam Sinister challenges you.  The hero picks a skill factor and both him and Sam Sinister add a die (re-roll Hooks and ties).  A defeat again means you lose an item.  A win means you take an item from Sam Sinister!  The other two bad guys are faced the same way, except that they don't move about.&#10;&#10;The Elephant (or any other means of transportation, if playing combined game sets) increases movement considerably since you now move one tile per die pip instead of one square (the tiles measure 5 squares across).&#10;&#10;The game ends when a hero reaches the final square with the Golden Shield.

221211,Battle of Souls,2016,"Battle of Souls is a 2+ player trading card game. In Battle of Souls you deploy (summon) warriors of different ranks and warrior sects to drain your opponents soul points (life points) and win the game. The theme of the game carries alone with historical warriors such as Samurai, Mongolian, Roman etc..&#10;&#10;In Battle of Souls, each player starts with 8000 life points which in our game is referred to as soul points. The objective of the game, or otherwise stated the win condition is to be the first player to reach 16000 soul points.&#10;&#10;This is done by dealing damage to your opponent from the attacks of your deployed (summoned) warriors.&#10;&#10;Each time your opponent takes damage of any type, including any cost to activate an effect, you gain that much SP (soul points) and vice versa.&#10;&#10;This mechanic insures that there will always be a definite victor and never a draw game. &#10;The second win condition is if one player runs out of cards to draw from their decks, they lose the game.&#10;&#10;GAME FLOW:&#10;Each player starts the game by drawing 5 cards from their deck to their hand. The first play to take a turn draws one additional card at the beginning of their turn. Each turn the player is able to deploy only one fighter (warrior, elite warrior, warlord, legendary warrior) to their side of the field. The first player to take his/her turn may not attack on that turn. The last player to draw is the first that can attack.&#10;The fighter cards are ranked in the following order, along with deployment requirements:&#10;Warrior &gt; No special requirements&#10;Elite Warrior &gt; Tribute a warrior that has 3 kill counters on it (kill counters are gained whenever a fighter destroys another fighter in battle)&#10;Warlord &gt; Tribute an Elite Warrior with 5 kill counters on it&#10;Legendary Warrior &gt; Tribute a Warlord with 7 kill counters on it, in addition to an Elite Warrior and Warrior on your side of the field.&#10;&#10;Equipment cards can be played face up or set face down to be used at a later time.

If the player is indeed a renegade, he stops play and joins the other camp (the game is still a 3v3 pawns). If he's not a renegade, the camp loses immediately 5 VP.&#10;&#10;",1,6,0,0,7.5,0.0,2

146278,Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends,2013,"Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends is a game played by masters of magic. Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player's own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards.&#10;&#10;Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc.&#10;&#10;In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don't expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score.&#10;&#10;The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent's moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,7.157,6.74814,7197
9398,War Games Rules  3000 BC to 1485 AD,1980,"From the Intro to the 7th edition rules&#10;The first edition of our original ancient rules appeared in 1969, and their adopted for the British National Wargames Championships of that year. Despite competition from many would be rival sets, succeeding editions have been used in every important convention worldwide since then, and are used by an overwhelming majority of ancient wargamers. Their mechanisms have become a wargames standard used for every conceivable historical period, including some for which WE consider then unsuitable!&#10;&#10;The seventh edition went to the printers in late 1985, and in the seven years since has almost completely taken over from previous editions. Feedback from play by several thousand customers has made it possible to provide free update sheets available in return for a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. A few of the amendments blocked minor loopholes, most clarify meanings and some incorporate goal ideas for improvements suggested and justified by players. All such changes to date are incorporated into the text of this printing of the rule book as Version 7.5.&#10;&#10;Seventh was a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change from previous editions. It places much more emphasis on realism, the problems of command, terrain and natural conditions, and seeks to distract players from excessive pre&mdash;occupation with weapon and amour differences important only if &ldquo;all things are equal&rdquo;. It is the function of the general to ensure that things are NEVER equal! We also take the view that a putative difference in weapon characteristics that cannot be shown to have influenced tactics in, or the result of, at least one historical battle is likely to be spurious. The tendency sung rule writers to show off their knowledge rather than produce the simplest realistic simulation is natural but unhelpful.&#10;&#10;The unanimous conclusion of the users is that seventh is far more realistic than other sets and greatly widens the gap between good and poor tacticians. They applaud the end of the ""fire work display&rdquo; with units whizzing off in all directions without getting in each other&rsquo;s way the increased mobility out of and the reduced maneuverability in proximity to the enemy the need to take conditions, terrain and the chance of a surprise into account when planning, the way the fatigue rules force a proper use of reserves, the way rebased troops no longer fall over in the box, and not least, the discomfiture of rule lawyers.&#10;&#10;Since its introduction, seventh has been used in the great majority of tournaments around the world, and even passed the fearsome test of the Milton Keynes 36 hour sleepless marathon event. Tournaments normally use the full rules with terrain choice, weather, unusual deployments and unreliable generals without these causing any difficulty or complaint of unfairness. A public demonstration game at Northern Militaire with one player per side each using 3,600 points of 25mm figures on a 6 foot x 4 foot table with plenty of terrain finished with a decisive win in something over two hours. This implies that increased realism has not been achieved at the cost of &ldquo;playability&rdquo;. Gums now play &lsquo;inch quicker.&#10;&#10;The major difficulty faced by players transferring from the previous editions is one of imagination. It DOES help to plan as if you wore commanding a real army rather than trying to analyze the rules to deduce goal tactics. Cannon mistakes are to leave cavalry at the rear of a marching column instead of scouting in front, keeping the general safe instead of in a position to see, letting an unreliable general continue disobedience instead of correcting him, ignoring terrain difficulties when deploying, with consequent traffic jams when moving out, accepting waver tests instead of avoiding then like the plague, deploying front and rear lines too close so that they became entangled, and leaving front line units to become exhausted or be overwhelmed instead of reinforcing or withdrawing then in goal tine. Victory with seventh edition goes to the player who has best learned the skills of real historical generals, not he with most grasp of the minutiae of the rules.&#10;&#10;Finally, although 7th is simpler than its predecessor and much simpler than its rivals, it is necessarily complex and needs large numbers of figures, a full sized table, and two or mare hours to play. For those occasions for which it will not suit, we recommend our other rule set for the period, the very successful &ldquo;De Bellis Antiquitatis&rdquo;. DBA allows much quicker games with far fewer figures on a 24&rdquo; square terrain, incorporates a campaign systen and army lists, and is especially suitable for beginners, the young, jaded elders, large multi-player gases and odd moments&#10;&#10;",2,2,120,180,6.18,5.51207,50

33664,"Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai, 1948-1949",2016,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 is an operational-level game about the largest and most decisive battle of the Chinese Civil War: the Battle of the Huai-Hai. This showdown determined that the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) would be driven from the mainland into exile on Taiwan. It was the culmination of 20 years of on-again-off-again civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.&#10;&#10;In 1946, the eight-year-long truce between Nationalists and Communists that had held together during the War of Resistance against Japan finally broke down. Both sides raced to seize cities and rail lines in China formerly held by the Japanese. By November, 1948, the Nationalists had suffered severe reverses in Manchuria and the north. The Communist leadership decided the time had come to move into central China, so they targeted the area around the strategically crucial city of Xuzhou, about halfway between Beijing (Peking) and Nanjing (Nanking). The result was an enormous battle of annihilation that involved over half a million fighters on each side. The Communists also mobilized as many as five million peasants to help move supplies.&#10;&#10;This is very much an Against The Odds! situation: The Nationalists are well-armed with air support, artillery, road mobility, and tanks. And yet it is the Nationalists who are going up ""against the odds""! Despite their material superiority, most Nationalist units have morale so low that ""defectors"" from their army are the main source of replacements for the Communists! The Communists are light, lean, and very well-motivated. The battle develops asymmetrically between the powerful but ponderous Nationalists and the mobile Communists.&#10;&#10;Designed by Earl Dixon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 features a map drawn to 20 kilometers per hex, with one week turns. There are over 150 unit counters and markers. Units are mostly Nationalist ""Corps"" and Communist ""Columns"" of about 20,000-30,000 soldiers. There are also artillery regiments and tank battalions: the Communists have a few; the Nationalists have a lot more. Both sides are subdivided (as they were historically) into ""sub-commands."" The rules cover unique aspects of this struggle: Nationalist Defections, Communist Guerrillas, the Propaganda Offensive, Communist ""Short Attacks"", Communist Re-Education, Red Militia, Nationalist Final Defense Positions, and more. Players may discern the early origins of the ferocious Red Chinese attack against UN forces in Korea a mere two years after this battle, as well as elements of guerrilla warfare that later became familiar in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;Virtually unknown in the West, this battle is quite familiar to mainland Chinese and to those on Taiwan as well. It's a fair description to call it the ""Gettysburg"" of the Chinese Civil War.&#10;&#10;",1,2,0,0,6.59722,5.51191,36

179648,Amen,2011,"User summary:&#10;Amen is an abstract stone-picking game with a theme of a struggle for the king's throne in ancient Egypt.&#10;&#10;You begin with a stone on a corner of the square-grid board. Each turn, you roll a die and extend your wall of stones by that number. When you place stones, you place the first one on a square adjacent to any one of your stones, then place each of the remaining stones adjacent to the stone you placed last. If that square, or the line of squares beyond, are occupied by opponents' stones, instead you skip these squares and place your stone on the nearest empty square beyond them. In this case, you pick up all the stones skipped over and gain victory points. But beware. When you pick up opponents' stones, you leave a gap between your walls, which is vulnerable to their counter-attack.&#10;&#10;At the center of the board, there are large obstacles you can use as your defense, and bonus stones which can be scored like opponents' stones.&#10;&#10;A game consists of rounds equal to the number of players, and a round ends when three minutes of real time have passed. Everything on the gameboard is held over to the next rounds, with an exception at the beginning of the final round, when the stones on four corners are removed from the board, allowing the potential of big points.&#10;&#10;At the end of the final round, the player who has picked up the most stones wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game comes with a sandglass to keep track of time, and an original music CD which goes well with the atomosphere of the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary:&#10;&#229;&#143;&#164;&#228;&#187;&#163;&#227;&#130;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#136; &#227;&#129;&#140;&#232;&#136;&#158;&#229;&#143;&#176;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#229;&#165;&#165;&#230;&#183;&#177;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#230;&#128;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#160;&#130;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#189;&#191;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#230;&#150;&#176;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#232;&#166;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#170;&#227;&#131;&#170;&#227;&#130;&#184;&#227;&#131;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#171;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#230;&#165;&#189;CD&#227;&#130;&#130;&#228;&#187;&#152;&#227;&#129;&#132;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#227;&#129;&#138;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#233;&#159;&#179;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#130;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#165;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#130;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#186;&#148;&#230;&#132;&#159;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#233;&#129;&#138;&#230;&#136;&#175;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#229;&#134;&#133;&#229;&#174;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#229;&#155;&#158;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#130;&#181;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#173;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#135;&#186;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#231;&#155;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#227;&#129;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#145;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#155;&#164;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#189;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#228;&#187;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#140;&#159;&#227;&#130;&#147;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#130;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#231;&#160;&#130;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#232;&#168;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#231;&#160;&#130;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#232;&#144;&#189;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#230;&#153;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#136;3&#229;&#136;&#134;&#233;&#150;&#147;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;1&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#168;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#166;&#143;&#229;&#174;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#230;&#149;&#176;&#239;&#188;&#136;2&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#157;2&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;3&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#157;3&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#128;&#129;4&#228;&#186;&#186;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#160;&#180;&#229;&#144;&#136;&#239;&#188;&#157;4&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#239;&#188;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#181;&#130;&#228;&#186;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#190;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#231;&#159;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#228;&#184;&#128;&#231;&#149;&#170;&#229;&#164;&#154;&#227;&#129;&#143;&#229;&#143;&#150;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#164;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#139;&#157;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;&#10;(Using Google Translate on the above Kanji text gives us:  ""Ancient Egypt stage.

Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.&#10;&#10;The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland&ndash;losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield&#10;&#10;Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy & Tactics magazine #151, along with Vittoria.&#10;&#10;A page of errata was published in S&T #153.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: approximately 1 hour&#10;Hex: approximately .6km&#10;Units: Brigade&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;One 22 x 34"" full color mapsheet&#10;One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2"" counters, approximately 100 per game)&#10;One 28-page combined Vittoria/Friedland/Napoleonic Battles System rules booklet&#10;&#10;Complexity: Medium&#10;Solitaire Suitability: Medium&#10;Players: 1 or more&#10;Playing Time: 1-2 Hours&#10;&#10;Players will have to provide one 6-sided die&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,5.97847,5.50982,59

Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.&#10;&#10;The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different ""pitches"" that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball. Various deceptions by the pitcher can be employed, such as opening the trapdoor while the ball is approaching the bat then closing it at the last moment so it will be a strike.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,7.0,0.0,2

Only after the blood and death that such an election as this can bring will a candidate be named Galactic President.&#10;&#10;Galactic Presidency is a complex strategy game that uses both cards and dice. In each round candidates (players) utilize an Alien Power and have up to three senators, each using a unique weapon, battle for supremacy in the GALACTIC ARENA. All senators start with the same amount of health for their ""head, body, and legs."" A senator is killed when they no longer have health in one of these areas. Besides the use of Combat Cards there are also random events that can help or hurt all senators and will in some cases kill them. Candidates can win ""Electoral Votes"" but the vote value is kept hidden and is only revealed and counted if there is no clear victor at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game can be played with 2 to 5 players, 12 years or older. The playing time is between 1.5 and 2.5 hours depending on your modifications to the rules - its easy enough to lengthen or shorten your game time. Our game is designed to promote ""enjoyment through creativity"" as well as keeping the potential to win the game even if the player had all of his senators killed.&#10;&#10;To win the game a candidate must win two of three rounds, which is when one candidate is left standing, or have the greatest number of Electoral Votes.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,5,90,150,0.0,0.0,0

Like it or not the real commanders had to trust subordinates to do their duty well. Often these abstract subordinates will make mistakes (represented by bad dice rolls), whether or not your subordinate's failure is catastrophic to your plan will depend on the allowances you have made for that possibility. This of course is a good reason to have plenty of reserves available.&#10;&#10;And speaking of reserves, the most unique aspect of Commit the Garde! is the use of off-table reserves.  No longer can your opponent see the deployment of your entire army. The location of your reserves is not determined until you commit them to the battle, at which time you place them where you want them (with limitations based upon distance from your Army HQ and proximity of enemy forces). The skill of your army commander and staff determine how effectively you can commit your reserves.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hex-grid map; the reason for this is to remove the ambiguities of ""free movement"" common to most miniature rules.  With hexes there is no doubt about a unit's location, it's facing, and what the range is to any other unit on the battlefield.  The intent with this approach is to make this a game/simulation of decisions, not of inches.&#10;&#10;",2,6,120,360,7.16667,0.0,3

240415,Desktop HEBOCON Battle Kit,2017,"&#229;&#141;&#147;&#228;&#184;&#138;&#227;&#131;&#152;&#227;&#131;&#156;&#227;&#130;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#179;, a.k.a. Desktop HEBOCON Battle Kit, is a Japanese game based on the theme of ""HEBOCON"". This is form of 'robot-wars' events, with microbots fighting Sumo matches. One robot must defeat the other according to Sumo wrestling rules, such as pushing them out of the circle, or flipping them to a fall. At HEBOCON events, people construct their own robots and fight knock-out matches to find a winner. HEBOCON is derived from the Japanese word Heboku, meaning 'bad' or 'heavy', something that is childish. HEBOCON is designed for people with little technical ability. This game recreates that experience in a simple build and fight way.&#10;&#10;During the game, players collect tiles and place them in their build area, a 6x6 grid. Gathering tiles and building is how the player programs their robot to fight. Players gain victory points during the Gather and Build stages, and get more VPs through winning fights in the Battle stage. The player with the most points will be the HEBOCON champion!&#10;&#10;In the Gather stage, each player takes turns to take a tile from a large circle of pieces. You move your robot forward, taking a tile from the circle. Each time the last player makes a complete lap, they place a nut on the gameboard to show a lap has been completed. Once each player has made nine circuits and collected a stack of nine tiles, then they start to Build. Whilst collecting tiles, players cannot look at their stack and must use their memory for what they need to build.&#10;&#10;In the Build stage, a player starts a digital timer and everyone has a brief time to assemble their bot. If a player fills out all 36 squares of their grid, they suffer a penalty as their robot is too technical! This reflects the same rules in HEBOCON. Players score points for a solid, connected build, which in HEBOCON is more important than winning a fight.&#10;&#10;Finally the players Battle with their bots, by placing a nut on a tile on their grid. These are the bots actions, such as moving and making turns in the sumo ring. Once combat is finished, the player with the most points overall is the winner.&#10;&#10;As well as all the boards and tiles, the game includes a digital timer and a bunch of metal nuts to mark actions in the game.&#10;&#10;Publisher's summary&#10;""Tabletop Hebocon&rdquo; is themed on HEBOCON, &ldquo;a robot sumo-wrestling competition for those who are not technically gifted&rdquo; .

What GRNDL does to the environment is nothing short of criminal.&rdquo;&#10;    &ndash;Tallie Perrault&#10;&#10;Fear and Loathing is the fifth Data Pack in the ""Spin Cycle"" for Android: Netrunner. The futuristic world of Android: Netrunner is one of vertiginous discrepancies between achievement and poverty. The megacorps that have redefined humanity with the development of custom genetics, bioroid manufacturing, and mind-machine interfacting are at least partially responsible for stabilizing social policies that mire countless masses in overcrowded, unsanitary living conditions. In the shadows of the megacorporations&rsquo; towering corporate headquarters, the vast majority experience mundane desperations, fear for their jobs, loathe their limited social status, and fight a daily war for survival.&#10;&#10;The sixty new cards of Fear and Loathing (three copies each of twenty individual cards) translate this dichotomous existence to your games of Android: Netrunner. On the one hand, you have powerful and exploitive business entities like GRNDL, a subsidiary of the Weyland Consortium, and on the other, you have the beaten down and fearful masses. But there are other categories, too, and while many people may be driven to silence, the game&rsquo;s Runners and other spirited individuals, like the investigative reporter Tallie Perrault, are driven to action.&#10;&#10;",2,2,45,45,8.12754,5.87919,374

It was not an idle boast.&#10;&#10;Napoleon's Grande Armee mustered 75,000 men, well-led, superbly trained, and completely confident of victory. And the next day, they would win the most decisive victory of Napoleon's career.&#10;&#10;The Battle of Austerlitz was Napoleon's tactical masterpiece. Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.&#10;&#10;The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.&#10;&#10;Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...&#10;&#10;&#10;     A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen. &#10;     A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge. &#10;     Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves. &#10;     Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics. &#10;&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Game Turn: 20 minutes&#10;Hex: 150 yards / 137 meters&#10;Units: infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries&#10;&#10;Solitaire Playability: High&#10;Complexity Level: Medium&#10;Players: 2 or more&#10;Playing Time: 4-8 hours&#10;&#10;",1,2,240,480,6.06713,5.52272,108

141918,Duel (fan expansion for Dominion),2013,"This is an unofficial fan-made expansion and is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Donald X. Vaccarino or Rio Grande Games.&#10;&#10;Victory over your neighbors has always been kind of a big deal for you, but just when you thought building yourself the single most impressive empire in the land was all you had to worry about, the stakes went and got higher. Your victory points are now tied to your very life! It all started with that foul-cursed gold. In the future, you will never trust anything given to you by a man in a village who won't stop spinning when you try to look at him. Of course, now you have access to incredible power, but each time you use it, you bring yourself closer to your own demise. With great power comes great responsibility &mdash; or something like that.&#10;&#10;Fortunately, you aren't alone in your fight. A ragtag band of mercenaries has arrived in the kingdom to save the day &mdash; or rather to fight for whoever has the coin. Your mercenaries can wreak havoc on your opponents, but if a stronger warrior takes them by surprise, the resulting curses find their way back to you. This war has turned you into a gambling man (or woman, as the case may be). How much of your own life will you risk to bring down your opponents? Oh, and remember to get your shots.&#10;&#10;For Duel, players need the Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and Trash card from Dominion or Dominion: Base Cards to play. As with other Dominion games, players must choose ten sets of Kingdom cards for each game.&#10;&#10;Duel introduces several new ""Curse"" cards to the game of Dominion, the generation of a more advanced ""Curse Deck"", and a new token: the ""curse token"". It also introduces a ""life points"" system adding another win-condition to the game; in games with this condition, curse tokens modify a player's ""Life Points"" total. (If the ""Life Points"" win condition isn't used, whenever a card requires a player to gain +Y (curse tokens), that player must take one curse token for each curse token specified by the number ""Y"". Each curse token is worth -1 VP.)&#10;&#10;Duel also introduces a new ""Attack/Action/Reaction"" card type, the ""Warrior Cards"". The strength of each Warrior Card is represented by a number within a shield symbol for each Warrior Card. The strengths of each Warrior Card range from 1-10, with 1 being the lowest strength and 10 being the highest strength. When a Warrior Card is played as an Action, the player playing the card first resolves the actions printed on the card in order from top to bottom (e.g. &ldquo;Gain a Silver&rdquo; for the Silver Knight; &ldquo;+1 Card then +1 Action for the Warrior Angel). After unique actions have been resolved, resolve the &ldquo;Each other player gains a Curse&rdquo; effect common to all Warrior Cards. This effect causes each player to draw a card from the Curse Deck or play a Reaction card in response.  These Warrior Cards can also be played as a Reaction card to another player playing a Warrior Card as an Attack card; In this case, the two Warrior Cards ""Duel"" eachother, and the one with the highest power wins the battle (and unique results are followed as indicated on the cards and within the rules).&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,4.6,0.0,5
144924,Gundam War Nex-A,2011,"The successor of the Gundam War CCG. Although most mechanics are still similar, Gundam War Nex-A was designed as the next ""age"" of the CCG, featuring a different card backs and streamlined rules.&#10;&#10;As the namesake implies, players take control of the various Mobile Suits and pilots of the different Gundam series. In addition to the previous shows, such as the ones set in the Universal Century like Zeta and Char's Counterattack, the game also features the alternate timeline series, such as Wing, 00, Turn-A and, the newest addition, Gundam Age.&#10;&#10;Similar to Gundam War, combat in Gundam War Nex-A is still divided into two zones, Earth and Space, with the players able to designate different Units into squads. Players attack one another in turn, attempting to deplete each others' Nation Pile(Draw deck), in order to win. Character or Operation cards can be placed on existing Units, giving the assigned Mobile Suit or Armor a bonus in its stats or additional effects. Command cards also give one time effects which players may trigger during their appropriate phases. Ace cards, the rarest card type typically found in boosters, combine Units and Characters into one cost efficient card.&#10;&#10;Unlike Gundam War however, Gundam War Nex-A no longer has Generation(Resource) cards. Instead, each card can be played as a resource. Further, Roll-ing(Tapping/activating) a card may now include a cost in resources. Alternatively, players have the option of using Graphic card, which combines resource generation, buffing and defense into one card.&#10;&#10;Though the card backs of Gundam War Nex-A are different from Gundam War, Gundam War cards can still be converted for use in Gundam War Nex-A, though with a penalty or drawback of sorts.&#10;&#10;Gundam War Nex-A is only available in Japanese.&#10;&#10;",2,2,30,30,4.0,0.0,2

Showcasing the many Battle Factions of the Untold universe, Untold Battle was created for two players to choose two opposing factions and fight with tooth, bullet, tentacle and spell until only one side remains. But Battle players are not limited - they can use all of the Untold cards to change and make their units unique, or even create their own character, just as if they were going to play the roleplaying game. And Battle doesn't need to be two sided, the rules work for one-on-one, one-on-many, or many-on-many. Untold Battle Rules provide a brutal, bloody, and hard-hitting game that packs a punch!&#10;The Battle Factions&#10;&#10;Untold offers limitless possibilities for worlds and adventures. And on every world there are nations, corporations, shadow organizations, alien marauders, and so forth; we collectively call these Factions. We've built all the unique creatures, minions, soldiers, and things that go bump in the night and put them together in Battle Faction packs, so you can pick your favorites or mix and match to do Battle. Untold Battle offers an arena for all the forces of your imagination to duke it out. Now you can pit zombies against soldiers, or tentacled demons against steam punk robots. Or you can help shape the destiny of one of the Untold worlds: will the brave forces of the North American Union overcome the twisted Flux Horrors? Or you can help reshape the face of Europe as the Churl Confederation advances on the new knights of Novus Europa!&#10;The Untold Rules&#10;&#10;Untold Battle utilizes Untold Minion Cards because they are quick to use. Minions are one card, instead of a number of cards, that represent a single character, and that is important when your Battle has a large number of forces. And Minions still offer the limitless customization of Untold Powers through Swapping.&#10;&#10;Once players choose their Factions and/or characters, Battle is as simple as lining up the cards on the table across from each other and taking turns between their minions.

Influence is measured in terms of INFLUENCE points. Different hands of cards acquired during the game will score different INFLUENCE points and the player with the highest number of INFLUENCE points wins at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player), the top card from the DECK is drawn and placed face up. Players can then take turns to bid and acquire this card using Oinks of the same element. The lowest bid is 1 Oink and players who pass will not be eligible to bid again in the same cycle of turns. Players may not bid for more than what they actually have in Oinks but the number of Oinks each player has can be hidden from other players during play. Each subsequent active bidder must offer a higher value than the previous one. The highest bidder gets the card and the next card is drawn from the DECK.&#10;&#10;While the rest of the unsuccessful bidders get back their bids, the amount of Oinks from the successful bidder is divided equally among the rest of the players. This is so UNLESS one of the players is holding on to a card whose FACE VALUE corresponds with the value of the bid or the unit value of the bid E.g. In a bid of 28, 8 is the unit value. If more than one player has cards with the corresponding FACE VALUE, they share the bid amount equally. If any player has more cards of the same corresponding FACE VALUE than others in this situation, he/she will get the entire amount from the bid. After dividing among the players, any remaining amount will be pooled to be accumulated for the next bid. If any division of the bid amount cannot be resolved, it will remain in the pool.&#10;&#10;Each time a player bids an amount with a unit value of 0 (E.g. 10, 20, 30), another card will be drawn in addition to the first one in the next bid as a set. Cards in a set cannot be bid separately. Players can bid using a mix of Oinks belonging to any element corresponding with the cards within the set. All acquired cards are placed in front of the players in clear view for others and a player may not bid an amount which has a unit value that corresponds to one of the FACE VALUE belonging to one of his/her cards. The game ends when there are no more cards to bid.&#10;&#10;INFLUENCE points are calculated in terms of sets. For each single card, 1 point, each set of 2 cards of the same FACE value, 4 points, each set of 3 cards of the same FACE value, 9 points and a full set of 4 cards of the same FACE value, 16 points. A set of 5 cards of sequential numbers belonging to the same element will receive 25 points, for 6 cards, 36 points, 7 cards, 49 points, 8 cards, 64 points and 9 cards, 81 points.

To start, you place a player token on the central hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first move a hexagon by rotating it 60&ordm; in either direction, or by swapping it with a neighboring hexagon or the hexagon on the opposite side of the glacier (keeping their orientations the same in the latter case). You then move the player token from a hexagon to a neighboring hexagon or the opposite hexagon &mdash; but only if these hexagons are both connected to the central hex by the same colored symbol. (On the first turn, you move the player token from the central hex to any hex of your choice.) You then flip over the glacier hex that you left to show ocean water.&#10;&#10;If you can't move your player token legally, you lose the game; if you can move it six turns, then you'll be standing on the last piece of ice, victorious.&#10;&#10;",1,1,1,1,5.0,0.0,1

149378,To Je Fotbal,2013,"To Je Fotbal (This Is Football) is a true simulation of a football match, a strategic board game that brings football action to your table by combining football rules and game strategy.&#10;&#10;To Je Fotbal is a game for two football managers. Each team consists of the basic eleven players and five substitutes. The players are marked with a colored base corresponding to their role on the pitch. The forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeeper and captain all perform different functions. The basic skills can be enhanced by using special cards according to the manager's chosen strategy. During one turn, the manager can move three players in any direction according to their attributes and kick the ball if it is in possession of the team. Playing time is 2 x 45 turns (and maybe extra time).&#10;&#10;The basic rules make it easy to get into the game for those aged 10 and up, and they cover situations such as passing, shooting, goal kick, saves, offside, posts, tacking for ball and position, extra time, substitutions and (of course) goals. The extended rules contain special situations such as corner kick, throw-in, free kicks and penalty kicks, fouls, yellow and red cards and even diving.&#10;&#10;The game pieces are miniatures of football players in team jerseys with names, numbers and even sponsors' logos. The atmosphere of a football stadium is completed not only by a full-colored 82x55 cm game board with goals, flags and advertising panels, but also by an imitation of a scoreboard. All components (special cards, scoreboard) are in English, with the printed rules in the box coming in six languages.&#10;&#10;The first edition, ""10th Czech vs Slovakia derby"", is supported by the Czech and Slovak national teams. You will find such football greats as Petr Cech, Tomas Rosicky, Marek Hamsik and Martin Skrtel in the teams.&#10;&#10;",2,2,90,90,6.83333,0.0,9

Those who dare to tread its pathways and cross its rivers should beware, evil deeds are planned tonight.&#10;&#10;The game is based on the original Hodder and Stoughton publication of Peter Pan and Wendy from 1921 which uses the illustrations of Mabel Lucie Attwell. The game takes extracts from the text and uses those original illustrations to capture the atmosphere and adventure of the book in an exciting game. The pieces and the packaging have been tastefully designed to make the game a collectors piece for children and parents to treasure today and throughout their lives.&#10;&#10;The player playing Peter Pan must set out to clear the mushroom clearings of pirates so the children can make good their escape. The player playing Captain Hook sets out from the Jolly Roger in an attempt to capture Peter Pan. His 6 pirates guard the mushroom clearings, making difficult for the children to escape. Players playing Wendy, Michael and John must find a way to the underground home.&#10;&#10;The game boils down to a roll and move with a card mechanic to throw some curves into the game. When Peter Pan and Captain Hook clash it becomes a dice duel between the two.&#10;&#10;The game includes a game board, hand crafted Peter Pan and Captain Hook pawns, 6 wooden pirates, 3 wooden children counters, 50 adventure cards, 30 pirate river cards and three wooden dice.&#10;&#10;",3,5,30,30,8.0,0.0,1

On their turn, each player places one of their god&rsquo;s followers on one of the buildings in the village.  Each god has the same two types of followers: Tsukumogami (Spirit Objects), household items possessing a soul that animates them and Zashiki-warashi (Kid Ghosts), playful child-like spirits.   Each follower has a strength value and once a building has five followers placed on it, the total strengths of each god&rsquo;s followers placed there are then compared.  Spirit Objects have a number that represents their strength, while Kid Ghosts have strengths that can vary through powerful special abilities which are triggered by the arrangement of other spirits at the same building.

The sun is setting and a warm light starts to shine from inside the gaping ship; it&rsquo;s the Smuggler&rsquo;s Cove inn.&#10;&#10;Four Captains sit at a round table at the center of the inn; some of the other guests are staring at the brightly coloured clothes they are wearing.

29371,Mini Bridge,1990,"Minibridge&#10;&#10;From wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia.&#10;&#10;Minibridge is a simplified form of the complex card game contract bridge designed to help newcomers and children learn the game.&#10;&#10;Like Bridge, Minibridge consists of four players, who play opposite and with their partner. Each player is dealt thirteen cards.&#10;&#10;The auction process is more simple than bridge. Each player counts the number of high card points he has (4 for an Ace, 3 for a King, 2 for a Queen and 1 for a Jack) and states the number of high card points. The partnership with the more high card points then has to play the hand. (If both partnerships have the same number of high card points, the hand is thrown in.) Of this partnership, the partner with the more high card points becomes the declarer. The partner with the fewer high card points becomes the dummy and lays out his hand. (If both partners have the same number of high card points, the one who states his high card point count first is the declarer.)&#10;&#10;The declarer then looks at his partner's hand and decides what suit he wants to be trumps (if any), and whether to be in game or to take part score. In part score he must make 7 tricks, and in game he must make 6 tricks (assumed) plus 3 for no trumps, 4 for a major suit or 5 for a minor suit.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Trumps&#10;&#10;         Partscore&#10;&#10;         Game&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Clubs&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Diamonds&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Hearts&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Spades&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         No trumps&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;The game then continues per bridge with 13 rounds of cards.&#10;&#10;The scoring system is also simplified.&#10;&#10;",4,4,30,30,5.9375,0.0,8

99435,The Lunar Chapters: INVINCIBLE,2011,"INVINCIBLE is a game of battle between endurance and courage. It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.&#10;&#10;Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned ""on the go"", and even first-timers DO win!&#10;&#10;Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. ""Action"" card with reddish background, ""Equipment"" cards with yellow background, and ""Special"" cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex ""rock-paper-scissors"" mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as ""ghost"" players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and ""resource redistribution"".&#10;&#10;&#10;    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,7,40,40,0.0,0.0,0

Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.&#10;&#10;Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning.

Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases.

The goal is still world domination, battle resolutions are based on the luck of dice, and the theme remains vaguely Napoleonic.  However, there are significant and interesting differences.  Most important is the use of simultaneous planning and execution of attacks.  Players write down their plans, and once revealed, battles are resolved in a prescribed fashion.  Also of note is the addition of several territories and connection points, changing the values of continents and making them more difficult to hold; yes, gone are the days of establishing an easy bastion in Australia.  The dice rules are significantly different, using 12-sided dice of various strength.  And still, there are other alterations that change the nature of the game, yet it retains the flavor of Risk.  Simply put, you are still playing Risk, but you no longer have to wait an hour between turns before you can play again; now it is always your turn.&#10;&#10;",3,8,180,180,5.4375,0.0,8

Wherever people gather, competition - and love of competition - appear.&#10;&#10;Even the lone mind seeks the stimulus of games, and in a sense the opponent is still the same. It is always fickle Fate - or our own limitations! - that we are trying to defeat. Games rise and fall in popularity, appear and disappear. Inventiveness, and love of novelty, are always modifying the old and devising new. Games have lives, histories, and family trees. Few of us today have heard of the medieval mine men's morris; but millions of hours are spent on bridge, and chess, and Monopoly - and millions of dollars at poker or roulette. This book covers games that the reader will have seen or heard about - family games and social games, games played for fun, and games played for profit. But it includes, too, many that will be strange: games from foreign countries and ancient times. All are presented through a unique blend of text and illustration. Here the reader can learn not only the secrets of bridge or chemin de fer, but also how to play pachisi or nyout, lasca, or hex, or go. In addition to clearcut, concise rules, the players and equipment each game needs are listed, while the guide on pages 316-317 groups games together according to the number of participants they require. With a little thought, then, it is easy to arrange and even improvise to try an unfamiliar game - whether to make a party go, or to keep a houseful of children quiet! This book will tempt the reader to relax and experiment. It will let him soon settle those old rules disputes. It will be a friendly guide to those games that ""everyone else seems to know"". We believe that it is unique - a unique aid to leisure. It is, in fact, the major reference book of how to play the games of the world.""&#10;&#10;",0,0,0,0,7.625,0.0,8

Instead, the entire game is designed to get you thinking about strategy right from the first strike of the ball. Each player in the game is rated for various Strokes such as 1st Serve, Backhand, Forehand Volley and Touch, from a low of F (a terrible shot for a pro player), to AA (one of the legendary Strokes in tennis history). Play Strategy cards to increase your scoring chances, defend against your opponent&rsquo;s Strokes, or try a variety of Tactics (Crowd the Net, Pick up the Pace, etc.) to shake things up.&#10;&#10;The fun comes not only from the wide variety of Strategy cards in play at any particular time, but also from the effects different cards have on each other. Do you risk hitting a Cannonball Serve, knowing that your opponent might have secretly played a card that negates it? Can you keep using Go for the Lines as a Tactic, knowing that you might miss, and hurt your scoring chances?

Much like Randolph's Twixt, the need to think several moves ahead is critical to out-maneuvering your opponent.&#10;In honour of the late Alex Randolph (1922 - 2004), who passed away in Venice, there is a picture of him on the box of the game.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;     Board Game Arena real-time or turn based&#10;     Boardspace.net real time or turn based, AI option&#10;     Yucata (turn-based)&#10;     http://www.brettspielnetz.de (German: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12) direct link&#10;     Jijbent.nl (Dutch: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12)&#10;     YourTurnMyTurn.com (English: turn based on a bigger board: 12x12)&#10;&#10;&#10;Mobile Apps&#10;&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS&#10;     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,2,25,25,6.46135,5.84252,1233

The game models the full order of battle that could be expected in 1980&rsquo;s wartime, from multi-regiment Soviet Tu-22 Backfire bombers to multiple US carrier groups.&#10;&#10;The game is card driven, with each card providing points to move units or trigger special events such as &lsquo;KGB Assassinations&rsquo; and &lsquo;Space Shuttle&rsquo;. There is also a reaction mechanic where most cards can be used in the other player&rsquo;s turn to perform a spoiling event such as &lsquo;Raid Aborts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friendly Fire&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;The heart of the game is detection. Task Forces can only be attacked once detected. By contrast, land air-bases can always be attacked &ndash; their enemy knows where they are. The race to detect opposing Task Forces begins as soon as they enter potential striking range of units such as the formidable Soviet bomber formations, or perhaps the Soviet&rsquo;s submarine fleet which, whilst it has considerable strength, cannot effectively detect enemy forces without help from its comrades.&#10;&#10;NATO must not only deliver convoys, but also protect its allies! Norway will be hard pressed, as will Denmark. Both will require urgent reinforcement. In the Mediterranean Sea, Soviet forces must be halted by naval aviation strikes. In the deeper seas, NATO may enact it&rsquo;s promised attack on the Soviet nuclear deterrent and the Soviets may attempt to respond. Perhaps the Typhoon SSBNs will flee under the Arctic ice to await doomsday, or hole-up in the White Sea. Perhaps the Soviets will use nuclear weapons and scatter those NATO forces that are no-doubt determined to bomb the Soviet&rsquo;s Kola Peninsula bases.&#10;&#10;The game models Politburo approval (Soviet leadership) through a stability mechanism, and whether the Soviets feel they can reduce New York to cinders through the use of &lsquo;First Strike Points&rsquo; &ndash; these allow the use of things like chemical or nuclear weapons.

However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.&#10;&#10;The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent ""fear"" that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included ""spiders"" and ""Wesley Snipes."")&#10;&#10;In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.&#10;&#10;Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.&#10;&#10;In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.&#10;&#10;",2,5,30,30,5.39683,5.45856,721

Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold.&#10;&#10;Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players).&#10;&#10;Later republished 1999 as Rosenk&ouml;nig by Kosmos, as part of the two-player game series.

Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a ""Knights"" solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. ""sandwiching""). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.&#10;&#10;",2,2,20,20,5.70623,5.50093,53

If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1.

97111,Fastscore Football,2010,"From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;A perfect complement to Second Season Football for solo replay projects.  FastScore Football allows the Replayer to quickly play out a whole day's schedule of games, including realistic scores, in just minutes!&#10;&#10;It's a quick play game that generates the score of a football game with a few rolls of the dice. It incorporates ease of play, a simple ratings system and simple charts. Hundreds of simulated seasons are run, ensuring the accuracy of each Fastscore season while factoring in each team&rsquo;s strength of schedule.&#10;&#10;Although the ratings seem simple, there is a great deal of background information packed into each rating. This game uniquely takes into account the offensive and defensive styles of each team by separating scoring frequency and scoring ability. For example, some teams may score frequently, but fail to execute in the red zone- thus adding points to the board with field goals more frequently than touchdowns. Others may rarely score but efficiently march into the endzone- thus scoring more touchdowns than field goals.   Additionally, offensive and defensive strengths in the running and passing game are reflected in the ratings and will influence the score of the game.  For example, teams with strong defenses against the run will more effectively shut down teams that rely on the running game.  And in close games, give your team a fighting chance by going for a 2-pt conversion!&#10;&#10;With Fastscore football, teams will perform similarly to their real-life stats in points for and against, touchdowns for and against, field goals for and against, and most importantly, their win-loss record.  These stats are fine-tuned to a 250-season average typically within 10 points of actual, and within 2 TDs and FGs of actual.  Strength of schedule is factored into the ratings to ensure the utmost in accuracy.&#10;&#10;And the best part: we&rsquo;ve included the as-played schedule for each season! And we didn&rsquo;t stop there- we know that your time is valuable, so we&rsquo;ve calculated the final team ratings for each game on the schedule- taking into account home field advantage and the run/pass ratings- so you don&rsquo;t have to do the calculations yourself.  Just sit back, roll the dice and mark down the score of the game.&#10;&#10;Fastscore Football is played using two differently colored 6-sided dice. Each team has seven ratings representing offensive and defensive abilities and a clutch rating. Better ratings are color coded in green while worse ratings are color coded in red. Higher offense ratings represent teams with punishing offenses. Lower defense ratings represent teams that effectively shut down their opponents.&#10;&#10;If you play Fastscore as a stand-alone game, you can finish a season replay in a few hours! You can also use Fastscore Football as a complement to detailed, play by play games like Second Season Football. If you are enjoying a single team replay, play your favorite team&rsquo;s games with your favorite football game while playing out the other games on the schedule with Fastscore, and see how your team is doing in the standings! A week&rsquo;s worth of games can be completed in less than 15 minutes!&#10;&#10;Fastscore offers great value for the gamer. Each Fastscore set includes multiple seasons for one low price!

Only two houses are needed before a hotel can be built, and the interest rate is fixed at $40.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game gets not only the satisfaction of having won over his or her opponents, but also has the privilege of consuming all the chocolate.&#10;&#10;Unlike the later Monopoly: Chocolate, this version is perfectly playable post-chocolate consumption through borrowing the same tokens, houses, and hotels from another Monopoly game.&#10;&#10;",2,6,1,1,5.05882,0.0,17

The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.&#10;&#10;The invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.&#10;&#10;This was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.&#10;&#10;The German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.&#10;&#10;Although casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.&#10;&#10;Operation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.&#10;&#10;As the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory? Of all operations of war, a withdrawal under heavy enemy pressure is probably the most difficult and perilous. Can you get the bulk of your forces to the southern evacuation ports? As the German, how quickly can you force the collapse of the Commonwealth morale and trigger their withdrawal?&#10;&#10;Features include:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Shifting Allied morale state based on relative casualties and key events, which can trigger evacuation and end-game victory conditions.&#10;     Random events, including tank breakdowns, misdirected airstrikes, and partisan attacks.&#10;     An option for Commonwealth naval support at the risk of losing precious ships to German air attacks.&#10;&#10;&#10;Thirteen scenarios include:&#10;&#10;     Separate one-map battles for the airdrops at Rethymnon, Heraklion, and the Maleme/Canea sector.&#10;     A one-map battle for the New Zealand counter-attack to retake Maleme airfield.&#10;     One-, two-, and three-map battles for the difficult German advance and Commonwealth delay and withdrawal.&#10;     The full campaign on all five maps or just the main event from Maleme to Askifou Plain on three maps.&#10;     Hypothetical German precision drops as well as a German free drop scenario.&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,2,60,1710,8.07922,5.64705,154

Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&#10;&#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three.

30314,Final Argument of Kings,1996,"Final Argument of Kings is a product of the same circle of players and designers who produced the Squad Leader board game and the Johnny Reb Civil War miniature rules.  Final Argument bears a strong resemblance to the latter but was designed to tune to the warfare of the middle part of the 18th century.  These rules are appropriate for games set from the time of the War of the Polish Succession (1734) to the beginning of the Wars of the French Revolution (1789.)  It is scaled to be appropriate for battle on the European continent.  For 15mm figures, one inch on the table represents 45-50 yards.&#10;&#10;Horse and foot units are each four stands and represent infantry battalions and cavalry regiments.  Artillery batteries are single stands as are army, wing, and brigade commanders.  The number of figures per unit is variable with each figure representing 40 soldiers or one section of artillery.  Stand size is variable with the number of figures so that units with more men cover a wider frontage.  (The game would be playable with other basing systems, but the game's basing has a number of subtleties that transmit the tactical feel of the time.  For example, units are longer in march column than they are wide in line as, indeed, they should be.)&#10;&#10;Turns follow a set sequence with simultaneous movement and fire of various types.  Each turn represents 20 minutes of time.  Players mark orders for units that are hidden from the opposing player.  Command is an important element but does not dominate the game or become obtrusive.  There is also provision for grand tactical movement so that maneuver and closing to battle may happen quickly without taking too much time nor sacrificing tactical detail.  Combat tends to be bloody with stands taking figure losses as a result.  Morale of units is a key game concept.  Units have a basic morale point that is altered by loss of strength and the local situation faced by the units.  Battlefield events trigger morale checks.  There are no saving roles.&#10;&#10;",1,12,0,0,7.0,0.0,2

There have been numerous attempts at this, but very few succeeded(if any), and his 'entry' is a long way towards fulfilling this accomplishment.&#10;&#10;What you get are a very large Ziploc Baggie to store it all within; (3)Booklets(designed for 1/285, 1/300, 15mm, or even 20mm); (1&1/2)-Full Color Sheets(providing Terrain Markers, a 'Compass', & 'Firing Arcs' for Guns & Target aspects); a ""Combat Results Table"" with the ""Sequence of Play"" on the reverse; a ""Terrain Effects Chart"" while on it's reverse are the ""Range Effects"", ""Mine Attacks"", ""Command Efficiency"" Tables & a ""Movement Orders Chart"" with a ""Scatter Diagram""; a ""Unit Roster Sheet"" while on it's reverse side is the ""Artillery Fire Target Plotting Chart""; there is a sheet of ""Unit VALUES Card"" while on the reverse of this are markers for ""Wrecks"", and small 'S' & 'D' ones; and Players will need to provide at least (1) or more DICE of the '12', '8', & '6'-sided variety, before commencing play. Players are given permission to copy anything pertinent to the gameplay using this 'system', and it is highly suggested for some items.&#10;&#10;Of the (3) Booklets included, the 'Minis' one is '28' pages long and details the Rules system; the next one is the ""Consolidated Weapons Data"" that is '24' pages, along with some 'Supplement' Sheets; and the last one is the ""Tables of Organization & Scenario Design"" which is '60' pages long. The ""Rules"" explain what to do during the ""Sequence of Play"" which is detailed as follows: 1)-Joint Plot Phase; 2)-Initiative Phase; 3)-Posture Determination Phase; 4)-Joint Indirect Phase; 5)-Joint Direct Fire Phase; 6)-Joint Movement Phase; & 7)-Marker Removal Phase. The ""Consolidated Weapons Data"" Booklet (and 'Supplement' Sheets) provide detailed information for many Nation's weapons and vehicles that are associated with them. There are even individual 'stats' for BOTH of Spain's ""Civil War"" participants(the Nationalists & Republicans!). The ""Table of Organizations and Scenario Design"" Booklet gives detailed make-ups of various Nation's Units and even during different periods of the entirety of World War 2! With these at your disposal, you should be up and running your own 'minis' based ""Wargame"" in very little time.&#10;&#10;",2,8,180,180,7.0,0.0,2

The game is designed for four players only. Players send their workers into four triumphal gates to gain or convert resources during action phase, then they spend resources to construct buildings and ramparts during construction phase.&#10;&#10;The distinctive features are variable cost and worker availability.&#10;&#10;Each gate has six action spots. Five of these spots enable you to gain or convert resources. From the leftmost spot to right, its effect becomes greater.&#10;&#10;The cost to send a worker is randomly determined by cost card. There are six spots which corresponds to action spots. From the leftmost spot to right, it becomes more costly. You may place a worker on any vacant spot, but doing so makes all spots rightward cheaper.&#10;&#10;You should note that workers you sent to a gate don't return until someone send a worker to the rightmost spot of the gate, in which case the rightmost worker contributes to the gate's influence, earning its owner income per round, and all other workers on the gate return. Then a new cost card is placed.&#10;&#10;During building phase, you may spend resources to gain coins, and construct a building and ramparts. Each building has its unique ability, and ramparts grants you victory points. The first player who has passed, takes these actions as many as they desire. Except for coins, all unspent resources are lost at the end of this phase, so you must plan ahead how many resources you need this round and where you should send your workers.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;user summary&#10;&#10;&#227;&#131;&#149;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#229;&#184;&#130;&#233;&#150;&#128;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#230;&#180;&#190;&#233;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#166;&#229;&#189;&#177;&#233;&#159;&#191;&#229;&#138;&#155;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#231;&#141;&#178;&#229;&#190;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#137;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#132;&#229;&#159;&#142;&#229;&#163;&#129;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#130;&#178;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#160;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#227;&#131;&#175;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#130;&#171;&#227;&#131;&#188;&#227;&#131;&#151;&#227;&#131;&#172;&#227;&#130;&#164;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#131;&#161;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#136;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#232;&#179;&#135;&#230;&#186;&#144;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#230;&#140;&#129;&#227;&#129;&#161;&#232;&#182;&#138;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#175;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#154;&#227;&#128;&#129;&#230;&#175;&#142;&#227;&#131;&#169;&#227;&#130;&#166;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#131;&#137;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#130;&#162;&#227;&#130;&#175;&#227;&#130;&#183;&#227;&#131;&#167;&#227;&#131;&#179;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#227;&#131;&#145;&#227;&#130;&#185;&#227;&#129;&#151;&#227;&#129;&#159;&#233;&#160;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#171;&#229;&#187;&#186;&#231;&#175;&#137;&#227;&#130;&#146;&#232;&#161;&#140;&#227;&#129;&#134;&#227;&#129;&#174;&#227;&#129;&#140;&#231;&#137;&#185;&#229;&#190;&#180;&#227;&#129;&#167;&#227;&#129;&#153;&#227;&#128;&#130;&#10;publisher's summary&#10;&#10;",4,4,60,90,7.03333,0.0,15

The first player announces the current vegetable (for example &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;) and plays one of his cards face down (which doesn&rsquo;t need to be a carrot!). The next player has two options. He can play a face down card and announce the current vegetable (he says &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;, but also doesn&rsquo;t need to play one). Or he can doubt the card of the previous player. In the latter case he looks at the previous card. If the previous player has lied (he did not play a &ldquo;carrot&rdquo;), that player has to draw a number of cards. If the previous player did not lie, the doubting player has to draw the cards. It is possible to play an action card in stead of a vegetable card. With an action card you can change the direction of the game, change the current vegetable or force a player to draw extra cards. The game ends when a player has emptied his hand or when the draw pile is exhausted for the second time. Remaining hand cards are penalty points.

186808,The Island of Doctor Necreaux: Second Edition,2018,"Create your agent, infiltrate the island, defeat Necreaux's minions, find the scientists, and escape before time runs out!&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux is a cooperative adventure game for 1 to 4 exceptionally talented secret agents set in a 50s-era pulp-sci-fi world. The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!&#10;&#10;In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.&#10;&#10;The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore). The game comes with quick start rules and multiple variants to increase replayabiliy and adjust thr difficulty to accommodate a wide range of player skill. The island and agent skills are all card-based, making the island and the agents different every time.&#10;&#10;We at Invisible City are excited about the improvements in the second edition:&#10;&#10;&#10;     All-new full-color art.&#10;     Almost all cards have their own unique art.&#10;     Full-color art on card fronts and backs.&#10;     More & better components.

240220,Gank,2019,"Gank is what a MOBA video game looks like when you convert it for the tabletop with euro-design. You don't push around a hundred miniatures on a map with a hundred grid spaces. You don't see dozens of trooper miniatures scattered across the battlefield on the various lanes.&#10;&#10;What you do see, are still the iconic 3 lanes that each leads to both your base and your opponent's. But these are very simplified and there are only 7 spaces on each of these lanes, which really act more as tracks. There are no actual soldier miniatures, but there is a frontline marker that represents the point at which each lane is being contested.&#10;&#10;It is deceptively simple! You just play down 1 of 5 Heroes (each hero taking unique roles - Carry, DPS, Utility, Tank, Support) from your hand, pick action cards from a pyramid that represent what the hero does that turn, and finally cast skills and spells from that hero. It is then your opponent's turn. Rinse and repeat until either one of the lanes has all towers destroyed and gets overrun by the opposing side, or one of the teams' morale drops to zero from having too many hero deaths, or a team manages to collect all Celestium crystals first and win immediately.&#10;&#10;To ensure this is the RIGHT game for you, do not go into it thinking that it is that simple or that it's a casual gateway game. Gank is intended for gamers who are already in the hobby for some time. This is a pretty HEAVY game in every sense of the word, and you have to watch for multiple things like which action cards NOT to take so the opponent does not have options opened up for them, what cards to deny them by picking those yourself (even if you don't really need them) and even looking for big combos between heroes!&#10;&#10;As for Hero miniatures, you have an option to make your game even more beautiful and get 3D representatives of your Heroes, or you can simply choose to use the more affordable alternative where Heroes are just cards in your hand. In the event you have the luxury of the premium miniatures, they are no mere decorations. You will use the miniatures heavily during the game as representatives of the Heroes being played out, their sequence and order etc.&#10;&#10;As mentioned earlier, the full action of the battle is represented by a pyramid-shaped layout of cards that you and your opponents take turns to pick cards from - starting from the bottom row. There are 4 types of cards, namely Farming, Attacking, Pushing and Treasure cards. Depending on the role of the Hero played forth, you will also pick cards with different rulesets. For example, the Tank can only take 1 card but does not take any damage from Farming cards (which others normally do). The Carry allows you to take 1 card, and then 1 more directly above it (this makes your Carry the most powerful role since it can access the higher tier cards faster) or the Utility Hero which takes any 2 cards in the same row, as long as they are different types. Sometimes on the cards, there are Celestium crystals to be collected, or materials to be farmed (usually from Farming cards) where you can later combine with Item Recipes to create powerful equipment for your Heroes. Gold and Mana are also acquired from these very action cards.&#10;&#10;Each Hero you play generally has 2 skills, one of which requires mana to perform. There is a 3rd 'Ultimate' skill that unlocks for them when they level up (there's only 2 levels in the game, so each Hero can only level up once)&#10;&#10;The game is played in Rounds, with each ending when the top card on the pyramid is taken. At the end of each round, there is a Planning phase. Players will spend their Gold to manipulate the battlefield. Because buying of strategy cards are secretive, players will inevitably experience exciting mind games. Will they buy card A? Should you buy card B to prepare for a counter?&#10;&#10;This game also features a 4 player mode of 2v2 where each player controls 4 heroes instead of 5, making it 8 heroes per team instead of the usual 5. The card pool is also larger by 5 cards per round, but all else stays the same and Gold, Materials and Crystals are shared in a team.&#10;&#10;",2,4,45,60,8.0,0.0,2

On a turn, someone leads a card, and players must follow suit if possible. For each Beutelschneider (cutpurse) you collect, you must subtract 20 points from your score for the round, which could put you in the red; the Beutelschneider is the highest ranked card in each of the non-trump suits, though, so ideally it will allow you to collect the 10-point gold sacks that rank far above the cards worth 1-4 coins.&#10;&#10;Many of the trump cards in Beutelschneider have special powers, and the deck even includes a bunch of violet special cards that can be added to gameplay if desired.

If noone can defeat the Dragon before it destroys the Royal Palace, everyone loses, making it a game where the players both compete against each other for treasure and against the game itself because of the Dragon-imposed time limit.&#10;&#10;",2,2,45,45,7.0,0.0,1

Players are not allowed to move diagonally and must always show their opponents the way they wish to take.

Cards are used to move, look at undiscovered tiles or attack your opponents.&#10;&#10;As soon as the first player discovers a canopic jar, the mummy awakes and starts to wander the pyramid.

13290,Byzantium Reborn,2004,"From the MicroDesign Group Website.&#10;&#10;THE GREAT IDEA&#10;&#10;World War I (1914-1918) left both Greece and T&uuml;rkey near ruin. By 1920, Greece was emerging from what amounted to a civil war between supporters and opponents of the visionary but reckless prime minister, Elefth&eacute;rios Veniz&eacute;los. T&uuml;rkey's civil war was still in progress, fought between the last, heartbroken Ottoman Sultan and the dynamic new insurgent, Mustapha Kemal (later called Atat&uuml;rk).&#10;&#10;Each side in the wider struggle pursued its own vision of national rebirth. For Veniz&eacute;los and Greece the dream was called ""The Great Idea"" and promised the renaissance of Greece as a great power through a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, the reconquest of Constantinople (lost to the T&uuml;rks in 1453) and the reunion of all ethnic Greeks under the rule of Athens. For Kemal's T&uuml;rks, their own ""great idea"" was the forging of a new, compact T&uuml;rkish Republic united not by the outdated creed of Islam but by a new T&uuml;rkish nationalism, modernized and empowered by Western culture and commerce.&#10;&#10;These two visions of national rebirth fought bitterly over the plains, deserts, and mountains of Anatolia for three long years. Western Anatolia was ethnically mixed, and neither side had an exclusive claim. The great prize was Smyrna, taken by Greece in 1919: a city which was home to more Greeks than Athens itself. The war had profound implications for the entire region. Greek victory would cement Greece as a regional power, and act as a beacon of hope to Orthodox Russians seeking to topple Lenin's Communists in the ongoing Russian Civil War. T&uuml;rkish defeat would mean the collapse of Kemal's vision of a secular, democratic T&uuml;rkey and would block the spread of Western values in the Near East, leaving T&uuml;rkey battered and backward, and the rest of the Moslem world feeling victimized and enraged.&#10;&#10;As it happened, T&uuml;rkey won and Greece lost. Kemal's vision prevailed; T&uuml;rkey emerged victorious, united and profoundly westernized. Women gave up the veil and went to school. The Roman alphabet replaced the Arabic, and Islam was evicted from politics. For the Greeks, the end came in September of 1922 when the T&uuml;rks captured Smyrna and burned the city to the ground. A million and a half Greeks fled or were expelled, and nearly 2,900 years of Hellenic civilization in Asia came to an abrupt and humiliating end. Greece, overwhelmed by refugees, collapsed into a series of coups and revolutions punctuated by all sorts of autocracy and spectacular misrule, from which, arguably, it has only recently recovered.&#10;&#10;Whose ""great idea"" will shape the modern Near East? Now you can make the decision by playing Byzantium Reborn!&#10;&#10;Byzantium Reborn is a simulation game on the Greek-T&uuml;rkish War of 1920-22. The game is for two players, one representing the Kingdom of Greece and its allies (the Greek player), and the other the insurgent nationalist forces of Mustapha Kemal who opposed the Greek invasion (the T&uuml;rkish player).

The winner is the team who builds the greater number of bigger squares, given that the score is the sum of the value of the built cubes.&#10;&#10;SETUP THE GAME:&#10;The players meet around the game board (ex. 4 players: Blue player, Yellow player, Blue player, Yellow player), so that they represent each player&rsquo;s turn. It is a custom that the game should start with a move from the Blue team and to proceed among the players of the teams in clockwise fashion. At the beginning of the match the board has no pieces and the two teams have all their pieces yet to be played respectively.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY:&#10;Each player on his turn can make only one of these operations:&#10;&bull;    Place of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Move of a piece;&#10;&bull;    Pass the turn.&#10;&#10;CONCLUSION:&#10;The match ends when all pieces have been placed and, therefore, the teams cannot make further moves. Interestingly, one of the teams will finish it&rsquo;s pieces before the other team and so can only make the movement (or pass) waiting for the opponent team to finish its remaining pieces. This phase is called the closure of the game. During the closure the team with pieces cannot move or pass.&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,30,0.0,0.0,0

88605,Tilting Dice,2010,"Tilting dice&#10;by James Ryan&#10;&#10;Tilting dice is a two-player abstract strategy game designed for use with Nestortiles. Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.&#10;&#10;SET UP:&#10;&#10;1) The board:&#10;Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.&#10;&#10;2) The dice:&#10;Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.&#10;&#10;3) Placing the dice on the board:&#10;Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.&#10;&#10;Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.&#10;&#10;Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.&#10;&#10;OBJECTIVE:&#10;The first player to ""capture"" one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY&#10;&#10;1) Moving dice:&#10;When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means ""tilting"" it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.&#10;&#10;Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.&#10;&#10;Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..&#10;&#10;Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.&#10;&#10;At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.&#10;&#10;Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.&#10;&#10;2) Making a capture:&#10;When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.&#10;&#10;Dice cannot be captured ""in passing."" In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.&#10;&#10;Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a ""matching"" tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.&#10;&#10;Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.&#10;&#10;Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.&#10;&#10;If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.&#10;&#10;STARTING A NEW ROUND&#10;&#10;Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.&#10;&#10;",2,2,0,0,8.5,0.0,1

The number on the top card determines their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player&rsquo;s turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will permanently lose cards from their hands.

Playable by 1 to 2 players in 1 hour, the game comes with a card-driven solitaire engine.  Designed by Maurice Suckling (designer of Freeman's Farm 1777), the game uses many of the concepts from that game.  However, added hidden movement, much more maneuver, and other design tweaks make this a truly unique game.&#10;&#10;Each turn players will play 1 of their 3 in-hand formation cards to maneuver or attack enemy forces, gaining momentum cubes based on the formation activated.  Each formation is a Confederate division or Union corps.  Each formation card will allow a major and possibly an additional minor activation, major allowing two moves for a formation while the minor allows one move.  After each formation moves combat can occur if a move ends in a location with an enemy formation.  Tactic cards may be played during the formation's activation giving it movement or combat bonuses.&#10;&#10;At the end of the formation card activation players may spend their momentum cubes to buy tactics cards which may give them benefits in combat or movement in future turns.&#10;&#10;Players then draw a new formation card refilling their hands to 3.  Hooker, Lee, and Jackson have bonuses that can be played once a game, adding to movement and combat.&#10;&#10;Victory is determined by destroying enemy formations through morale/strength loss, or the Union occupying the three victory locations which represent cutting off the Confederate army from Richmond.&#10;&#10;Additional rules allow for fixed defensive positions, Jackson's Flank March -- and even his death.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",1,2,45,90,7.7839,5.67695,188

63918,Detective,2009,"Overview - You are a citizen in a city, either working for the good guys (the Innocents) or the bad guys (the Guilty). The game consists of several ""trials"" that take place. There is a narrator who is the judge of these trials. He runs the trials but must remain impartial. Every trial ends either with everyone going to sleep (mistrial) or with an execution. The Innocents are trying to convict the Guilty criminals while the criminals are trying to remain hidden and get Innocents executed. Also, one or two of the Guilty criminals are murderers who kill a citizen after every trial while everyone sleeps.&#10;&#10;The game centers on someone who is the Detective trying to hunt down all of the Guilty before they murder everyone. If the Guilty try to kill the Detective, the final round of the game commences. The citizens may still vote to convict criminals, but the Detective has his trusty sidearm and can shoot citizens at will! But he must be careful, if he kills any Innocent player the game is over and the guilty win! There are also several roles to help the Innocent (heroes, lawyers, vigilantes...etc.) and the Guilty (serial killers, pyromaniacs, dirty cops...etc.). All roles are hidden, so make sure you don't trust your friends, they might be trying to get you killed!&#10;&#10;Gameplay: Detective is a role playing/negotiation/strategy game similar to Mafia/Werewolf. It is slightly more complicated and advanced, and should probably be played by people who have experience with those games. You are dealt a role telling you your powers and which side you are on. You must then try to figure out who is on the opposing side and get them executed, and who is on your side so that you may protect them. Revealing your role card is not allowed, but feel free to lie and deceive your way to winning.&#10;&#10;Components: All that you absolutely must have is the deck of cards to play (which can be found here). But it is strongly recommended that you play this game with a loaded cap gun for added tension and theme. Dark lighting and theme music will also enhance the experience.&#10;&#10;",7,20,20,20,6.0,0.0,5
100014,Whirred PLAY,2010,"Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;&#10;&#10;What is Whirred PLAY&trade;?&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; is a unique word game designed so that anyone can win regardless of their vocabulary and designed so that everyone can play together no matter the composition or size of the family or social group.&#10;&#10;Reason Whirred PLAY&trade; was Developed&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; was developed because existing board games did not satisfy a need to be able to play a game with the whole family where everyone was challenged and mentally stimulated, but where everyone had an equal chance of winning. Games of chance such as &lsquo;snakes and ladders&rsquo; and &lsquo;ludo&rsquo; can be won by anyone, but they do not offer a lot in the way of mental stimulation for those taking part and soon the thrill of being able to play a board game together as a family diminishes.&#10;More intricate family board games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; do provide the level of mental stimulation required. However, one is much more likely to win these games if one has more life experience (to be able to play strategically) and more education (knowledgeable about a subject). As a consequence younger family members, or those with self perceived lower life skills, shy away from playing these games because they always expect to get beaten.&#10;&#10;In order to encourage these groups of people to join in, adults will often have to play below their best to give them a chance to win and to maintain their interest in playing the game. Whilst this is fun for a while, it soon becomes difficult for the adult to gain enough satisfaction from playing the game from the levels of satisfaction achieved by seeing their offspring&rsquo;s delight at winning.&#10;&#10;How is Whirred PLAY&trade; Unique?&#10;&#10;So Whirred PLAY&trade; enables everyone to play a game at their own level of skill and strategy, but whatever their level this does not determine whether or not they are more or less likely to win. Whirred PLAY&trade; is open for any number of players to join in at the same time, so unlike when playing &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; (maximum four players) or &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; (maximum six players), no member of the family or social group need sit on the sidelines. Everyone can join in the fun.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that at all times in the game everyone always has a chance of winning, no matter their position on the board, until the eventual winner crosses the finishing line. In games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; there will come a point where it is obvious certain players are not going to win.  Some participants may decide that they will leave the game at this point and that can have a detrimental effect on the pleasure of all parties involved in playing the game. This also may become a hindrance for future participation from those who have departed early. A special feature of Whirred PLAY&trade; is an element of the game called &lsquo;Pare Up&rsquo;, especially designed to provide ample opportunity for players to bring the leader back to the chasing pack.&#10;&#10;Another element of Whirred PLAY&trade; that ensures maximum interest from all parties is that any particular game should last no more than 30 minutes. &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly, in particular, can run on for long periods of time and this can be a barrier for those with shorter attention spans, usually children, to want to take part. And with over 440 cards in Whirred PLAY&trade;, there is very little repetitiveness, as a typical game usually only utilises 30 to 40 cards.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the game play of Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that everyone is participating all at the same time. No-one has to wait for any one particular player to finish their turn, which in some other family board games can often be quite a long time.&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; is Educational&#10;&#10;As Whirred PLAY&trade; is based on the simple premise of spelling everyday words that just happen to be homophones, a key stage two literacy curriculum topic, it has high appeal amongst both parents and teachers as an excellent fun method of teaching children this difficult subject. Children will want to play Whirred PLAY&trade; because of all of the elements of inclusivity and equality listed above, and parents will be delighted that a game they want to play offers more than just a fun half hour.&#10;&#10;Schools can utilise Whirred PLAY&trade; in formal teaching classes due to its all inclusive nature and the ability for the whole class to participate in it, with an equal chance of winning it, at the same time regardless of its size or composition. The competitive nature of Whirred PLAY&trade; especially appeals to boys, traditionally a more difficult group of students to enthuse about learning how to spell.&#10;&#10;Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;&#10;&#10;So Whirred PLAY&trade; really is a board game like no other. Everyone can take part, everyone has an equal chance of winning, everyone can apply their own level of strategy and utilise their own level of life experience, everyone is involved at all times, everyone can win at all times during the game, no-one gets bored, everyone gets educated and everyone has fun.&#10;&#10;",4,0,30,30,10.0,0.0,1

In the same way that European language fonts come in different designs (Times New Roman, Gill Sans) and different styles and weights (Gothic, Bold), many fonts are also designed for the Japanese alphabet Hiragana. Fontworks produced a popular commercial font called &#231;&#173;&#145;&#231;&#180;&#171; (Chikushi), which is then produced in various styles and weights.&#10;&#10;The game uses a set of tiles which only show a single character &#227;&#129;&#130; (A).

Track tiles may be placed on top of each other, and matching sets of animals may only be collected if the connection is made by establishing a new(!) route between them.&#10;&#10;Each animal tile has one to three animals on it, and each player's end score is equivalent to the total amount of animals on the gained tiles. The one who collected most animals is the winner.&#10;&#10;What appears to be a very simple tile-laying games with an appealing farmyard animal theme is quietly hiding a rather clever maze game that challenges children on multiple fronts. There are only four different track tiles in the game, yet there are so many ways to place these that a bewildering amount of new routes have to be considered. Visualizing the one that would connect two identical animal types, let alone spotting the most profitable one can be a challenge even for adults.&#10;&#10;But kids love tiles, and kids love puzzles, and the rules are so intuitive that they easily get engrossed in an entertaining game. The best children games do far more than simple entertaining, and by having to match identical animals, create new routes between them, and consider the relative value of two matched tiles (2 hens and 3 hens is better than 1 sheep and 2 sheep) half an hour of fun is well spent indeed. There are 68 animals on offer, so even determining the final scores can be a quick math lesson.&#10;&#10;The suggested age range is from 7 upwards, but it is such a good bridging game that it would suit even slightly younger children. For kids at the younger end of the spectrum, it might be simpler to settle for ""whoever has the highest animal stack wins"", but even then there is enough left to make this a game worth considering.&#10;&#10;Also known as ""Dierensporen"" in Dutch and ""Pistes d'Animaux"" in French.&#10;&#10;",2,6,20,20,5.0,0.0,3

Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.&#10;&#10;The core of your turn in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn&rsquo;t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like &ndash; until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything. Knowing when to stop and ""bank"" your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns.&#10;&#10;The cards&rsquo; special abilities are key to success in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, and they build off of each other. Each suit in DMD has an effect that the player can target when they flip a card of that suit.&#10;&#10;Anchor &ndash; Keep everything you drew before the Anchor even if you bust.&#10;&#10;Cannon &ndash; Destroy one card an opponent has previously banked.&#10;&#10;Chest &ndash; Double your haul by banking as many cards directly from the discard pile as are in the river when you bank the Chest &ndash; but only if you also bank a Key.&#10;&#10;Hook &ndash; Play one of your previously banked cards.&#10;&#10;Key &ndash; Enables the Chest special.&#10;&#10;Kraken &ndash; Oh no!

23311,Carrousel,2006,"Carrousel is a game without turns. The board shows a carrousel with seven spaces in a circle. Placed on this (on five adjacent spaces) are five different-colored horses. The game also contains a deck of cards, each showing three horses in different colors.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player is dealt nine cards and lays them out in front of herself. The object is then to make the three horses at the front of the carrousel be in the same order as on one of one's cards. When this happens, you get a point for that card (put it upside-down in a private score pile) and get to draw a new one.&#10;&#10;There are a number of legal moves to make, like swapping the places of two horses, placing the last one first and so on. To score a card, you must perform a move to make the first three horses match one of your cards. If you make a move and they don't fit, you lose one point. If you're not fast enough, someone else will move something, messing up your plans.&#10;&#10;The game has been illustrated by St&#195;&#169;phane Poinsot.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Here's a strange merry go round!

192075,Battlemind: A Game of Battle Strategy,2016,"Battlemind is a medieval-themed battle strategy game in which two players, each with 10 character cards, try to capture/kill the other player's King. Inspired by the game from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels (HBO's Game of Thrones is based on this series), Battlemind combines the strategic elements of Chess, Stratego, and Blitzkrieg to create a an easy to learn but hard to master game with infinite replayability. This game is for anyone who loves strategy games - not just fans of the books!&#10;&#10;What makes Battlemind special? Instead of being played like a typical card game (dealing/drawing), it is played more like a board game, with players setting up a ""board"" made of terrain cards and moving character cards across them.&#10;&#10;Like chess, each character card has a certain number of spaces in which it can move. But that's where the similarities end. Each character has a strength value (1-8) which dictates whether it can capture/kill another character as well as certain advantages and disadvantages over other characters. From the lowly Rabble (rabble is like an angry mob) to the powerful Dragon, every unit has a purpose.  How you use them is up to you!&#10;&#10;Finally, each terrain type can benefit or hinder your character. Use terrain to slow your enemy down, protect your fortress, and even hide from Dragons!&#10;&#10;Ultimately, how you set up your terrain, arrange your army, and advance your units will determine whether you will be the victor or the vanquished. You'll laugh at your opponent when he places a crucial unit on his front line that you are able to capture easily, but will be crushed when that same placement allows him to capture your dragon on his first move in the next game!&#10;&#10;Will you create a defensive stronghold and make your advesary come to you?  Or will you storm the front lines in hopes of catching your opponent off guard?&#10;&#10;It's your decision.  The fate of the Kingdom rests on your shoulders. Fight for honor.  Fight for glory.

The German Army, over-committed and under-equipped, was soundly defeated; thousands of its troops, in addition to much of their equipment, were captured in the Falaise pocket.

Actual coins count $20,000 each - coin cards have designated values $2,000 or $5,000.&#10;&#10;Equipment:&#10;Gameboard and trays with 12 ""money bags"", 10 real uncirculated coins from 10 different countries symbolizing valuable ""rare coins"", 10 Coin Selection Cards, and 50 playing cards.&#10;&#10;Method of Play:&#10;1. Players sit opposite each other&#10;2. Remove coins from bottom of box (undernearth plastic tray).  Place coins at random, (in full view of both players) one under each of 10 ""money bags"" (2 bags will remain empty).&#10;3. Dealer shuffles the small Coin Selection Cards (those depicting the actual coins used in the game) and deals five to himself and five to his opponent, alternating and FACE UP. During the subsequent play of the game, each player will try to obtain as many of the coins shown on his small cards as possible. Obviously, this combination of coins will change with each game.&#10;4. Dealer shuffles the Playing Cards and deals five cards to himself and five cards to his opponent, alternating, and FACE DOWN.  The remaining cards are placed faced down in the DRAW tray.&#10;5. Players pick up the five playing cards. The dealer draws a card and must then play a card from his hand either in front of him to count toward his score, or into the discard tray. At no time after playing a card may a player have more than five cards remaining in his hand.&#10;6. If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then ""search"" for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the ""money bags"" and declaring, for example ""the Turkish kurus is in this bag."" He then lifts the ""bag"" and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the ""bag"", he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the ""money bag"".  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.&#10;7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.&#10;8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.&#10;9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.&#10;10. If the ""Draw"" tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the ""discard"" tray and continue play.&#10;&#10;WHO WINS:&#10;The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards.

32970,Pirogue: The Trinidad and Tobago Tarpon Tournament,2006,"Pirogue: The Trinidad and Tobago Tarpon Tournament is a trick-taking game inspired by big game Tarpon fishing in the warm, blue waters of Trinidad and Tobago.  The name of the game references the local hand-made flat-bottom wood boats used for fishing in the shallows of the surrounding Caribbean and Atlantic waters.&#10;&#10;The play of Pirogue will be challenging play and good fun for gamers who enjoy games such as Tichu, Sticheln, Pinochle, M&uuml; & Mehr, Spades, or Oh Hell!  The game will also be a great companion for sportsmen who want to play a card game which couples concentration and skill with the same sense of anticipation and suspense found in a real big game fishing tournament.&#10;&#10;One of the most important things for the first-time Pirogue player to learn is the abilities of the SPECIAL cards.  Each SPECIAL card adds a different and subtle tactical twist to the game.  Some cards even have different strengths depending on whether the card is the lead card in the trick or a following card.&#10;&#10;Unique to Pirogue is the HOOK card.  The HOOK card is a unique trick-taking device specific to the game.  The HOOK card addresses the unpredictability and surprise found in sport fishing while adding another level of tactical play.  The HOOK card also assists in removing the predictable run of the table for the strongest of hands because even the lowest SUITED card is a dangerous threat.  Recognizing the strength of a well balanced hand over what may seem like a traditionally strong hand is an important part of understanding Pirogue play and key to successfully making a bid.&#10;&#10;Also distinctive to Pirogue is linked play between partnerships and individuals.  In big game fishing tournaments, prizes are awarded for both best boat and best angler.  The game of Pirogue is played in partnerships called Pirogues as well as by individual players called Anglers.  Pirogues and Anglers compete in an intertwined, and sometimes entangled, opposition to win Game Trophies that count towards taking home the ultimate prize: The Trinidad & Tobago Tarpon Tournament Trophy!&#10;&#10;",4,8,60,60,0.0,0.0,0

The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.&#10;&#10;To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a ""shared planar deck,"" which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one ""Chaos"" ability.&#10;&#10;Players also need a six-sided die, called the ""planar die."" Each Planechase pre-constructed deck comes with a ""planar die"" that has four blank faces, one ""Planeswalk"" face with the ""Planeswalker"" symbol, and one ""Chaos"" face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If ""Chaos"" is rolled, the ""Chaos"" ability of the current plane card triggers. If the ""Planeswalk"" symbol is rolled, the player ""planeswalks away"" from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been ""planeswalked to."" A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.&#10;&#10;Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.&#10;&#10;Planechase 2012 introduced the ""phenomenon"" card type. A player may have up to two different phenomenon cards in his or her planar deck, which cannot have the same name.

B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts and went on sale that date. In the May 1843 Boys and Girls magazine, the components of the first edition were described: a gold embossed thumb-hole cloth (maroon) case with printed instructions card (yellow) and four sets of 5 cards, each set outlined in a different color: brown for the Busby family, red for the Doll (the dairymaid) family, yellow for the Ninny-come-twitch family, and blue for the Gardner's family.&#10;&#10;S(tephen). B. Ives continued to hold the Ives' games copyrights after he and his brother William dissolved the business in April, 1854 (as mentioned in William's newspaer, The Salem Observer).&#10;&#10;Stephen's son, Henry P. Ives partnered with A. Augustus Smith to take over the business until Henry bought Smith out in 1861 according to the 1861 Salem directory.&#10;&#10;Stephen, his son Henry, and elder son David (with a dry goods business in Boston) continued to publish the game until 1887 when the last remaining Ives' family member, Henry, sold the copyrights to George S. Parker.&#10;&#10;During the interimum, editions were printed by the Ives' family with Milton Bradley labels, Henry P. Ives and Selchow & Righter labels, S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow labels, and S. B. Ives and E. G. Selchow and E. I. Horseman labels.&#10;&#10;According to a letter many publishers were associated with Dr. Busby until 1886 but they really were purchasing and reselling Ives' published games.&#10;&#10;In the 1890's McLoughlin Brothers ignored the copyright and put out there own version as did many other major American game manufacturers. That is why you see so many publishers of Dr. Busby in the 1890s.&#10;&#10;George S(winterton) Parker made grandiose claims about the games he published which lead to a number of mistakes by historians who failed to go back to the primary sources when describing the history of Dr. Busby.&#10;&#10;Consequently,  sParker Brothers rulebook...&#10;&#10;""This game was the first ever published in America, being brought out of Salem in 1840.""&#10;&#10;Anne Wales Abbot may have first made a prototype of Dr. Busby in 1840 but there are no primary sources to prove this is the case. It may be because the first edition that was published by W. & S. B. Ives is called The Improved and Illustrated Game Of Dr. Busby. Before that published edition with an 1843 copyright, no other earlier editions have been found with or without a copyright date.&#10;&#10;George S. Parker, in his 1895 edition of the board game, The Mansion Of Hapiness, made another incorrect claim. The game box cover states that The Mansion Of Happiness was the first board game published in America. There are at least three copies of F. & R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through The United States (copyright 1882) and one copy of F. &. R. Lockwood's The Travellers' Tour Through Europe in private and museum collections. So Parker was wrong in this claim too.&#10;&#10;RULES:&#10;The game consists of 20 cards, divided into 4 families: the Busby Family, the Dairymaid's Family, the Ninnycometwitch Family, and the Gardener's Family. Each family has 5 members, for example the Busby Family consists of Dr. Busby, his Wife, Son, Servant and Dairymaid's black-eyed Lover.&#10;&#10;The starting player begins by asking the player on his right for any card not in his own hand. If that player has the card he calls for, he gives it to him and the starting player may call for another card and so on until he calls for a card which the player doesn't have. Then the next player takes his turn, but must first call for those cards which have been called for and obtained by the first player. Thus it becomes a game of memory since any incorrect call ends a turn. When a player has called every card from the player on the right (thus putting that player out of the game), he may continue to call from the next player on the right. At the end of the game, the winner will have successfully called all the cards into his own hand.&#10;&#10;",4,5,20,20,4.0,0.0,1

37637,Polemos: Franco-Prussian War,2008,"POLEMOS - FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR&#10;&#10;When Emperor Louis Napoleon declared war on Prussia in Summer 1870 he was at the head of an army that most contemporaries regarded as the leading military force in Europe. No doubt he had plans of recreating the Glory of his illustrious namesake Uncle. What actually happened was a campaign that saw the Prussians invading France and the Imperial army capitulating at Sedan. Louis Napoleon abdicated and the French carried in the war under the auspices of the Third Republic.&#10;&#10;As a wargames period, the FPW remains largely unexplored. There seems to be a general myth that the uniforms are boring, the battles one-sided and that information is just too hard to get to those of whose language skills do not include French and German. As it happens, nothing could be further than the truth than these stereotypes. The French can have a large variety of brightly dressed and colourful units, ranging from the Imperial Guard to the Zouaves and the North African Turcos. You can even field the French Foreign Legion! The Prussians number a significant contingent of allied German troops who all add their own colour and variety to the army, especially the large contingent of Bavarians. Infantry battalions still fought carrying their colours into action and the deployed armies make a brave show on the wargames table. The Prussians may have their superb artillery arm, but the French Infantry were armed with the Chassepot rifle. Tactics were in state of flux as armies were coming to terms with the change from Napoleonic tactics to ones more suited to the greater range and lethality of rifles and artillery. No greater example of this can be seen than the presence of Cavalry units whose purpose was still to charge the enemy with cold steel as their fathers and grandfathers had done.&#10;&#10;If you've not considered 1870 before then it is well worth a second look!&#10;&#10;Although the war involved unprecedented numbers of soldiers, there was a great deal of variety in the size of the battles. the French army that fought at Wagram was ten times the size of that which fought at Vimiero. It is a lot to ask of any single;e set of rules to cope with such diversity.&#10;&#10;Polemos FPW is therefore produced as two sets of rules in one book. The first set, Commandant de Battaile will allow the wargamer to fight battles with armies of up to corps size. The second set, Kommandant der Armee will allow the wargamer to refight the BIG battles of the period.&#10;&#10;The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal - only the nominal scale will differ.&#10;&#10;Polemos FPW aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts.&#10;&#10;[u]Basing and Representation[/u]:&#10;The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos FPW is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position and number of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.&#10;&#10;[u]In Commandant de Battaile[/u]:&#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of infantry represents an infantry battalion - about 500-1000 men. &#10;A 60mm x 30mm base of cavalry represents a regiment or three to four squadrons. &#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery or mitrailleuse base represents two batteries each of 6 guns.&#10;A 30mm x 30mm Officer base is use for Generals, Corps and Divisional commanders&#10;&#10;[u]In Kommandant der Armee[/u]:&#10;60mm square bases are used. These can be formed by using two CDB bases, butted up one behind the other or a single larger base which allows a more creative and dioramic approach.&#10;A 60mm square base of infantry represents a brigade or division of 1500 to 3000 men.&#10;&#10;A 60mm square base of cavalry represents a brigade or division of 750 to 1500 men.&#10;&#10;A 30mm x 30mm artillery base represents 18 to 36 guns,&#10;&#10;All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.&#10;This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. All Baccus 6mm Polemos army and booster packs are organised on this basis.&#10;&#10;",2,8,0,0,7.0,0.0,2

The Teen Titans are all about proving themselves, and with this set you can save your best cards for when you really need them. When you&rsquo;re ready, unleash everything you&rsquo;ve got and the results will be spectacular.&#10;&#10;The big new focus of DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Teen Titans revolves around Ongoing abilities: Cards that stay in play until you need them. Every time you put an Ongoing card into play, it essentially gives you an extra card to utilize on a future turn. Previously, only Locations and a couple of other cards could ever stay in play. Now every card type at every power level has multiple different cards with Ongoing. Sometimes they help you every turn. But mostly they stay in play until you choose to discard them for their mighty effects. If you can build up several Ongoing cards, unleash as many as you need to take down the Super-Villains!&#10;&#10;This set also pays attention to the different card types you have in play. Playing cards from your hand puts cards into play as usual. But with Ongoing cards out there, you often have several card types in play already.

You won't use the ""extra queens"" during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.&#10;&#10;In the end, all cards except the ""old maid"" (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!&#10;&#10;The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them.

18061,Chennault's First Fight,2005,"Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.&#10;&#10;Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.&#10;&#10;Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a ""battle board"" that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.&#10;&#10;Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.&#10;&#10;Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather. Plenty of carnage and mayhem!&#10;&#10;",2,2,300,300,6.63258,5.5251,55

670,Starship Troopers,1976,"Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:&#10;&#10;""We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.""&#10;&#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:&#10;&#10;""A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.""&#10;&#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as&#10;&#10;"" . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.""&#10;&#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.&#10;&#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:&#10;&#10;""The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...""&#10;&#10;As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.&#10;&#10;The game is set up in a ""Programmed Instruction"" system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. ""Flores died on the way up"") to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.&#10;&#10;Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race.

A special effect is added if you roll a triple or a sequence.&#10;&#10;Then you may transform three jewels of the same colour into a ring, or any three jewels into one jewel of your choice.

The Space Marines wear powerful space battle suits and carry heavy weaponry. The Genestealers (reminiscent of the alien in Alien) are naked, except for their quick movement, multiple clawed arms capable of ripping through Terminator armor and their seemingly endless numbers.&#10;&#10;Each game is played as a scenario.  The Space Marines win by completing a certain goal, such as retrieving an artifact and escaping alive.  The Genestealers win by stopping the Space Marines from achieving their goal, usually by killing them all. A unique mechanism is that the Genestealers have no time limit for their turn, but the Space Marines have a 3 minute time limit, and less if a sergeant is killed. This simulates the fact that Genestealers move so much quicker and adds a lot of tension to the game for the Marine player.&#10;&#10;The miniatures are excellent although you do have to paint them yourselves and the modular board is very well done.&#10;&#10;The Deathwing Expansion adds new personnel, weapons, rules for multilevel hulks, new missions and a mission generator along with some complexity.&#10;&#10;The Genestealer Expansion adds new marines, weapons, Genestealer Hybrids who can use weapons and new missions.

Of late, His Most Catholic Majesty had graciously agreed to accept arbitration for so-called &lsquo;wrongs&rsquo; done to British traders, waiving compensation for similar wrongs done to Spain. But when she offered payment, the English dogs slapped Spain&lsquo;s hand aside, saying it was not enough! This insult will not go unavenged. The King has ordered you to secure our trade routes and has issued letters of marque for the harrying of British merchantmen &ndash; let their own methods be used against them! In the fulness of time, our brother France has promised his support.&#10;&#10;Control the seas and you control the fate of the New World. Whichever side you choose, glory and honour &ndash; and prizes galore &ndash; are yours for the taking. Provided you avoid court martial and disgrace.&#10;&#10;Yellow Jack is a naval war game for two players, set during the years 1739-1743. It explores the roles of the navies of Britain, Spain, and France in the Caribbean. Scale is &ldquo;operational&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the playing pieces represent squadrons of as many as four ships, rather than individual men-o-war. Other counters represent leaders (good and bad), &ldquo;light&rdquo; forces such as frigates and galleys, and &ldquo;formations&rdquo; that allow you to concentrate your forces.&#10;&#10;Tactical themes are eschewed in favour of operational issues: keeping your forces in fighting trim, being at the right place at the right time, & dealing with a mounting list of instructions, orders, and unfilfillable mandates from your Government. Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required. Special features of Yellow Jack include the Hurricane Season, amphibious assaults and land campaigns, and the Yellow Jack itself &ndash; Yellow Fever.&#10;&#10;Time Required: 3 hours for a Minor Scenario; 1 weekend for the Campaign Game. As a bonus, there are also scenarios for 1744-1748, when the Caribbean struggle became submerged in the greater War of the Austrian Succession; these allow an Extended Campaign covering 1739-1748.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;6 die cut counter sheets &ndash; 720 counters &ndash; including the naval forces of Britain, Spain, and France, plus Pirates (no Caribbean naval game is complete without Pirates). One of the counter sheets includes all the important naval leaders who participated in the War of the Austrian Succession; another consists of land units &ndash; all the regiments that fought in the Caribbean. There is also a sheet of generic markers.&#10;&#10;37 wooden disks representing &ldquo;task forces&rdquo; (boxed game only; regular counters are also supplied to represent these items).&#10;48&rdquo; x 54&rdquo; map depicting the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Carolinas coastline.&#10;&#10;1 series rulebook, 1 exclusive rule book, 2 scenario/OOB books, 1 set of charts & tables, historical commentary. 1 set of display cards.&#10;&#10;",2,3,0,0,8.16667,0.0,6

Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!&#10;&#10;In the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight ""The Daedalus Sentence"", a grim tribute to the facility's designer.&#10;&#10;As the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.&#10;&#10;The main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!&#10;&#10;Enemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.&#10;&#10;The Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group. In addition to a four player co-op game, The Daedalus Sentence can also be played one-versus-all, with a player taking the role of the labyrinth and its minions.&#10;&#10;",1,4,45,60,6.63427,5.60293,232

For two or more players.&#10;&#10;Gladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.&#10;&#10;Gladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.&#10;&#10;These rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try.

At the start of a round, each player places one of their cards face down to predict how many chips will be played that round. Players then take turns, and on a turn you can either place a chip in the playing area or pass. Do you add chips to get closer to your prediction at the risk of losing more of your chips, or will you pass and let your opponent control the conversation?&#10;&#10;Once either both players have passed or a total of nine chips have been played, the round ends and players reveal their cards. If your card is closer than your opponent's to the total number of chips played, you win and collect all the chips played, plus two additional chips from your opponent. If the two cards are equally close to the total, whoever last took an action loses and whoever passed first wins.

A small warship with a perfect balance of speed, armament and resilience that made it one of the perfect vessels for single-ship action and privateering against merchant ships. It usually had one main gun deck as well as the guns positioned on the top decks. These were categorised as either 5th or 6th rate within the British Rating System, dependent on the number of guns they mounted.&#10;&#10;The 5th rates were the archetypal frigates of the period. Used for single-ship actions and privateering, they could make their crews very rich as a result of the share of the prize money for any captured ship. A frigate was a desirable posting for a Royal Navy officer as they often saw action, so glory and promotion were more likely in addition to monetary benefits.&#10;&#10;Frigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with ships-of-the-line; Indeed, even in the midst of a fleet engagement, it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first...

Each player starts with two randomly-drawn tiles in hand, with each double-sided tile depicting 1-3 types of landscape out of the four types present in the world.&#10;&#10;When play begins, each player simultaneously starts laying tiles into the frame; each tile must be adjacent to two sides to be placed, so initially tiles can be placed only in the corners of the frames, with players building inward from there. Players can place tiles anywhere that they can legally be placed (two sides are adjacent to the frame or previously placed tiles and all landscapes match across tile borders.&#10;&#10;Instead of placing a tile, a player can place it in their personal discard area, which can hold at most ten tiles. When a player has both hands free, they can draw two new tiles from the bag; alternatively, any player with a free hand can pick up any tile in any discard area and place it in the world.&#10;&#10;At any point during the game, a player can claim one of four gods and that god's followers. Each god is associated with a particular type of landscape, e.g., the merfolk god. Once a player has followers, they can place a prophet on a tile they just placed to claim that section of landscape. Players can place any number of prophets in a landscape as long as they're placing each prophet on a tile they just added to the world.&#10;&#10;At any point in the game, if a player thinks that a section of the board cannot be filled with a tile &mdash; e.g., a space that's surrounded by four types of landscapes &mdash; that player can place a round city marker in that space, and then claim that city with a prophet. If a matching tile is found later, a player can ""smash"" and collect that city, replacing it with the tile.&#10;&#10;Once the world is filled or players agree that no more tiles can be placed, the game ends. Each player scores five points for each city occupied or smashed. Each landscape with one or more prophets is worth a number of points to the player(s) with the most prophets in it equal to the number of tiles in that landscape minus the number of prophets in it. The landscape with the largest mass rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest masses rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses; similarly, the landscape that appears in the most distinct groups rewards its god with a large bonus, with the second and third largest groups again rewarding their gods with smaller bonuses.&#10;&#10;Whichever god has scored the most points wins!&#10;&#10;",2,4,15,30,5.94981,5.63418,974

288572,The Third Winter: The Battle for the Ukraine September 1943-April 1944,2021,"The Third Winter: The Campaign for the Ukraine, September 1943 - April 1944, begins with the &ldquo;Race to the Dnepr,&rdquo; as Army Group South rushed to a secure defensive position behind one of Europe&rsquo;s largest rivers.   Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.&#10;&#10;The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  &#10;Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.&#10;&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army&#10;&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles &#10;&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.&#10;&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.&#10;&#10;The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units.

When that type of animals is removed, the token holders score points equal to the number of tiles removed or twice that number.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a certain number of migrations are made, and the highest scorer wins the game.&#10;&#10;&mdash;user

Graf Spee comes complete with die-cut counters, rules booklet, battle board and two movement boards.""&#10;&#10;Another entry in the long line of AH Bismarck-style search and battle naval wargames, this one is very rare. As the name implies, it covers the search for the German ""pocket battleship"" Graf Spee in 1939.&#10;&#10;With the usual low-quality Third Millenia components (especially the counters) and very simple rules, it is nevertheless a pretty fun game.&#10;&#10;Like AH Bismarck, Midway, et al, movement and search are conducted on the two identical map sheets, and battles are resolved on the battle and charts sheet. Turn order is:&#10;a. German player rolls for bad weather (no searches). German player moves.&#10;b. British player searches.&#10;c. British player moves.&#10;d. German player searches.&#10;e. If both in same hex, resolve battle.&#10;f. When all battles are resolved, advance the turn record and start over.&#10;&#10;The British can search the hexes ships are in, and one more hex within four hexes (search aircraft). Aircraft carriers (4 British and 1 French) can search the six adjacent hexes. The German player can search the hexes ships are in, plus the Graf Spee has two search aircraft that can search within four hexes. The German player can also search any other three hexes on the board (u-boat reports?).&#10;&#10;Both players must keep track of fuel expenditures, and both have supply ships available to re-fuel (or they can re-fuel in ports). Every other turn the German player can roll on a table to sink one (or two) merchantmen. If he sinks any, he then rolls on another table to see how many turns later he must inform the British player in which hex the sinking occurred. The German player must sink a number of merchant ships and escape the map to win; otherwise the British player wins.&#10;&#10;No indication is given of map or time scale.

24827,Traders of Osaka,2006,"In Traders of Carthage, players are merchants who are attempting to ship four different types of goods from Alexandria to Carthage. Players affect how quickly or slowly the ships move and can trigger pirate raids that may cost their opponents their goods. (Traders of Osaka moves the gameplay to a new continent and era, with players now trying to deliver cargo from Osaka to Edo, but otherwise gameplay remains the same.)&#10;&#10;The game has a small board that shows the route the ships will follow, marking safe ports and dangerous waters. The board also has two spaces for the draw pile and discard pile and shows where the Market and Farm cards are laid out. The game also contains a deck of cards that have multiple uses, 48 achievement tokens for when goods are sold, four ship pieces to mark how far the ships have sailed, four trader pieces to indicate a player's scoring pile, four reservation pieces for players to mark cards they wish to purchase or take on a later round and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;The game is a set collection game at its core. Players are attempting to collect sets of goods that will allow them to collect cards that will be worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the cards can be used to represent goods when laid out in front of players, to represent gold to purchase goods when played from their hands or urns which players will use to protect goods from pirates. Deciding how to use the cards and when is the basis of playing the game.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, they can do one of three things: Buy Goods, Get Coins or Reserve a Card.&#10;&#10;Buying goods has the player buying cards from the Market. There will be a number of cards laid out, face up, in the Market. Each card has a gold value in the corners and indicates how much a card is worth (either 2, 3 or 5). When a player buys goods, they must buy all the cards in the Market, using cards in hand to pay. If a player cannot afford the whole Market, they cannot do this action. Any cards purchased this way are laid out, face up, in front of the player. These goods are now aboard the ship of the matching color. Then the player moves each matching ship either 1 or 2 spaces towards Carthage (1 space if 1 card of that color was purchased, 2 spaces if 2 or more cards were purchased). If a ship moves onto Carthage, a payout occurs and pirates attack (this will be explained in detail later). If the Market is bought out or if the current player can't take or buy market cards (due to reservation pieces), the cards in the Farm (3 face up cards) are moved to the market. 2 cards are drawn from the draw pile and are added to the Market. Then 3 new cards are drawn for the Farm and are placed face up.&#10;&#10;Getting coins has the player taking a single card from the Market and placing it in his hand. That card is now money, its value indicated by the gold value in the corners. This is the only way players can increase the amount of money they have.&#10;&#10;Reserving a card has the player placing their Reservation piece on a card in the Market or in the Farm. This card is now unavailable to all other players. The Reservation piece is now committed to that card and can't be taken back until the owning player acquires the reserved card either as money or as a good. The owning player may take the card on his next turn or leave it, assuming there is another legal play he can do.&#10;&#10;After taking his turn, the next player takes his action, and so on until the game ends.&#10;&#10;If a payout occurs, each player that has goods on that ship takes part. First the players count how many of that colored good they have. Then they look at the value of the goods and determine which has the highest value. They take that value and multiply it by the number of cards in the set, rounding up to the nearest 5 or 10. For example, if a player has 3 yellow goods and the highest value is 3, they would multiply 3 by 3 to get 9, then round up to 10. The player then takes that value and divides by 5. The result indicates how many cards of that set the player keeps. Keeping with the example, the player would divide 10 by 5 to get a result of 2. This means the player keeps 2 out of the 3 cards from the set. Players keep the lowest valued card first and work their way up until they have the reached their limit. These cards are placed face down near the players with their trader piece on the pile, indicating this is their scoring pile. At the end of the game each card in the scoring pile is worth 1 point. This procedure is completed for each ship that reached Carthage. Then those ships are moved back to Alexandria, ready for another voyage. Each player that had a payout then takes 1 achievement token for each color they scored (not each card they scored).&#10;&#10;When during a payout, any player that scores and has matching achievement tokens to the scored goods, will add the amount of tokens they have to the highest value card in the set. They then figure out how many cards they keep. For example, if a player has 3 blue cards with the highest value being 5. The player also has two blue tokens. The player would add 2 (for his tokens) to 5 for a value of 7. Then he would multiply 7 by 3, getting 21 and round up to 25. After dividing 25 by 5, the player can keep 5 cards. If a player gets to keep more cards than in the set, as in this example, they keep the entire set and draw cards from the top of the draw pile to make up the difference. These drawn cards are kept face down and are added to the score pile.&#10;&#10;After the payout, any ships that are in the two Pirate spaces are attacked. Affected players may now discards cards from their hand to protect their goods on those ships. Each card has either 2, 1 or no urns on them. When you discard a card with 2 urns, two goods of that color are protected from the pirates. For example, if a player has 2 blue goods and discards a blue card with 2 urns, then he may choose which two cards are protected. After all players have finished discarding cards (which is voluntary; players are not required to protect their goods), the attacked ships are moved back to the nearest safe port and may move again towards Carthage.&#10;&#10;The game ends once a player has 8 or more Achievement tokens. The winner is the player with the highest score (number of cards in their score pile). If there is a tie, the tiebreaker is the number of Achievement tokens the tied players have. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,6.808,6.31509,3522

20133,FAB: The Bulge,2008,"The Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series - Volume 1: The Bulge&#10;&#10;From Rick Young, designer of Europe Engulfed, comes a series of fun, tense block games. FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.&#10;&#10;Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.&#10;&#10;FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. &#10;&#10;&#10;Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Series Designer: Rick Young&#10;Series Developer: John Foley&#10;Published: 2007&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Wargameroom (real-time)&#10;&#10;&#10;",2,2,240,240,7.35604,5.93844,672

His ""One with the Earth"" ability keeps him safe from enemies when in the woods and his ability to summon woodland creatures at any Green Location to attack Minions (even when he is not present) is extremely useful in keeping Orcs and Imps under control.&#10;&#10;&bull; Elf Lord: The Elf Lord knows the secret pathways through forests, enabling him to travel swiftly through all green locations. His mastery of Elf Magic enables him to assist himself (or other heroes) with a re-roll of one die each round, and his ability to ambush Minions and Generals in combat makes him a strong warrior in support of the realm.&#10;&#10;&bull; Monk: The Monk, a wanderer on some sacred quest for her order, is a master of the Martial Arts, enabling her to land a fury of blows with her staff on the unfortunate minions and Generals she encounters.

A breakthrough here, as well as further south at Sedan, would split the Allied forces in two. A protracted and bloody battle was not in the German war plans...speed was of the essence...the blitzkrieg depended on it...Hitler demanded it!&#10;The French forces, caught off balance by the sudden attack, were initially aided by the terrain but not for long. Rommel was a determined foe and the Meuse River was looked upon as only a temporary delay. It proved a little more than that and provided the vital time for the French armor division to move into the area despite harassing Ju-87 dive bombers and a lack of fuel and organization.&#10;The Panzers soon found how inferior their little armored tanks were against the likes of the Char B, which could split any of the panzer metal from long range. Even the lighter French tanks were as good or better. In fact, Rommel only had 24 Pz IV's, which could take on the French tanks. His remaining 68 Pz II or 91 Czech-38 were simply too weak in armor and and in gun.. The French 47mm gun could rip a Pz III apart from 1500 yds. However, the French use and slowness negated their armor and gun to a large extent. German tanks were faster and well commanded and could take on the French tanks by firing from the rear or flank.&#10;The Battle at Dinant was a tough fight, but across the sweeping vistas of France, the fast moving Germans caused a French command in chaos. Rommel would also have another surprise in another week or so at Arras. There, the British sent chills down the German command when Matilda IIs launched their counterattack. German fire simply bounced off their thick armor causing Rommel to get desperate. He ordered his four 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons.

71272,Hornet,2010,"Hornet is an area control game with simultaneous action selection and a dual-layered resource system. The game board is a modular board built of hex tiles representing a landscape with fields of flowers and hornet nests of various sizes. The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.&#10;&#10;Box back text:&#10;Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit.

One player controls the German army, and the other player controls the Soviet army. The game uses a simplified version of the Area&ndash;Impulse System, first introduced in Avalon Hill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Storm Over Arnhem&rdquo;. The game is 6 turns long, at the end of which time the winner is determined by comparing the players predetermined controlled victory areas to actual.&#10;&#10;The prize at the end of Germany's 1942 summer offensive was Stalingrad. The city, while being a propaganda key due to its name, was also a key industrial city sitting upon both rail and river networks. The German 6th Army hit arrived at the west bank of the Volga by late August and began their assault on the city. ""Stalingrad must not be taken by the enemy"" ordered Stalin. Now you can command the defense of the city and try to hold versus a talented, but stretched thin, German Army. Or will you find something the Germans didn't and seize both the city and the day?&#10;&#10;As has become common with games in the IGS line, playability matched with historical flavor has been achieved to a remarkable degree. In Storm Over Stalingrad, players alternate impulses where they move or fire, but only rarely both. Cards influence play, but do not drive the game. Can you take most of the city of Stalingrad before the Soviet offensive begins?&#10;&#10;This game uses a simplified version of the Storm over Arnhem system.

19838,Disposition,1974,"The board contains 2 circular tracks, 20 spaces long, and with a coloured dot that separates each two neighboring spaces. In the center is space for 3 plastic containers with a slot in the lid. Each player gets 2 pawns, 5 fuel chips in each of the 4 colours, and 3 sticks. Each player places their pawns on the board, one on each track, next to a dot of their colour. The aim of the game is to be the first player to return both pieces to their starting positions, moving one pawn round clockwise, and the other anti-clockwise.&#10;&#10;It is a diceless game: players are in control of their own movement. Any unoccupied space can be reached as long as, and here&rsquo;s the twist, the player has enough &ldquo;fuel&rdquo; to reach that square. Remember those chips? For each square traveled, one chip has to be handed in. The landing space determines which colour those chips should be. Used chips are then put through the slots of the containers in the middle, spread between them at will. At the start of the game, each player only has enough chips to get one pawn round the board. To get both pieces round additional fuel need to be bought. During your turn, you can buy the hidden contents of one of the containers by discarding one of your three sticks. If you have run out of sticks and you haven&rsquo;t got the right chips left to get home than you are out of the game.&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s a lightweight but rather clever racing game for the entire family, but its diceless movement system sets it apart from most racing games aimed at this market.&#10;&#10;Disposition was licensed from B.L.A. and published by Berliner Spielkarten in their ""Spiel-O-Thek"" range.&#10;&#10;",2,4,30,30,7.59091,0.0,11
