81305,Quarterback King,2010,"Quarterback King is a board game which unites the sport of football and the game of chess into a fun, strategic game for two players. The game pieces are set-up in a traditional football formation, on a twenty-four square by ten square checkered football field board. The object of the game, like football, is to outscore the opponent. One player manages the offensive game pieces, trying to maneuver the quarterback towards the opponent&rsquo;s end zone for a score (touchdown or field goal). The other player manages the defensive game pieces, trying to capture the quarterback or prevent its advancement toward the goal line.&#10;&#10;Pieces are moved one at a time, similar to chess, beginning with the offensive team, then alternating to the defensive team. Each game piece is assigned a specific directional pattern of movement. Once a piece is captured it is removed from the game board. If the quarterback is captured, players switch roles, with the defensive team becoming the offensive team at the point of capture and vice versa. All pieces are returned to the board and play resumes.&#10;&#10;Scoring: A touchdown is seven points; a field goal is three points; a safety is two points.&#10;&#10;Game Timing: The game is played in two halves or four fifteen minute quarters.  Each coach is allowed three timeouts per half.&#10;&#10;Play timing: The offensive coach has thirty seconds to move a piece.  The defensive coach has fifteen seconds to make a responding move, which makes for a fast-paced and pressure packed game of strategic fun.&#10;&#10;This description is attributed to Cort Hubbard, the game designer.&#10;&#10;",2,2,90,90,7.5,0,2,[],['Sports']

208284,Scratch Wars,2017,"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Scratch Wars is close to a collectible game, but in certain game modes it's closer to a board game and can be also played online through a phone application for iOS and Android.&#10;&#10;In more detail, to start playing Scratch Wars you need only two cards: one hero and one weapon. The cards are unique in several aspects. You can scratch them like lottery tickets, but by doing so you are not destroying or devaluing them. Each hero card is unique; each hero has a unique name and value generated. No one else in the world will have the same card! Slowly uncover the card by scratching it and in combination with unique values, it is pleasantly thrilling. Cards can even be bought individually. (Would you rather have a hero or a weapon?)&#10;&#10;With an increasing number of weapon cards, you can try a sophisticated one-on-one duel in which you equip your hero with up to five weapons, then think strategically to find out which one to use when. The duel itself is very interesting; you spin a special circular weapon: turntable paper on a stick. The hero has certain levels of energy which you spend using various weapons. Heroes can change weapons during the turn and their proper use is the focus of the game. The game is risk management; you are trying to spend the hero's energy for the best possible effects. According to the composition of effects, you choose weapon, strategy and risk. You can attack the opponent's weapon, his permanent effects, or the hero directly. You have to decide when to repair a weapon, when to save energy for the hit with more powerful weapons, etc.&#10;&#10;Once you get into the basic game, you can try a more comprehensive and strategic mode in which teams of heroes compete against each other. Then you can move to the top mode where entire armies of heroes collide. With more than two players, it is possible to play in teams or each player plays by themselves with modified rules. The game is perfect for tournaments.&#10;&#10;If you want to play with just one player, simply scan the card into your phone and you can play online. There is a varied range of options at your disposal, from tournaments and hero trainings to territorial fights. The goal is to level your hero up and obtain spells for him. As the first game in the world, Scratch Wars presents digital ownership so that what you have physically, you also have digitally. If you later want to replace or sell any of your heroes, you can change them digitally with all that is recorded on the card, i.e., with all the spells and experiences.&#10;&#10;If you would rather play the game more as a board game and add more strategic options, you will be able to expand the game with ""trade"" cards or hero's ""abilities"".&#10;&#10;",2,8,7,30,6.16429,0,14,"['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck']","['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting']"

Das Magazin (Sonderausgabe 15 Jahre Myranor - 2015),N/A,"Publisher blurb&#10;&#10;Sonderausgabe 15 Jahre Myranor&#10;&#10;Im Oktober, auf der Messe in Essen, feiern wir 15 Jahre Myranor!&#10;Nicht immer sah es so aus, als w&auml;re so ein Jubil&auml;um zu erreichen. Der Anfang war offenbar nicht so, wie man sich das vorgestellt hatte &ndash; was sicher f&uuml;r beide Seiten des Werkes gilt, Leser und Autoren.&#10;Das Kleine hatte schon einige Schwierigkeiten bei seinem Start ins Leben. Die Zeit bis zum Kindergarten war holprig, wenn auch ambitioniert, und munter stapfte es drauf los. Meist war es in warmen Zonen unterwegs und erz&auml;hlte uns alles, was es so fand und sah. Vieles von dem, manche meinten gar alles, trug Fell. Das war neu und damit gewann es nur wenige Freunde. Andere wurden schnell davon abgeschreckt, dass es nach vermeintlich alten oder gar falschen Regeln lebte. So schwand das Interesse und es wurde recht still um das j&uuml;ngste Kind von Los und Sumu. Mit&#10;der Zeit bekam man den Eindruck, auch die Eltern h&auml;tten das Kind versto&szlig;en.&#10;Eine Handvoll Unerschrockener sammelte sich, das Kind auch weiterhin zu begleiten, seinen Geschichten zu lauschen, es mit eigenen Erz&auml;hlungen zu unterhalten und seine Entwicklung ganz&#10;allgemein zu f&ouml;rdern. Die Namen dieser fr&uuml;hen Helden sind Benjamin Filitz, Johannes Borgwardt, Ines Krtschil, Jan Philipp Fiedler, Bernadette Wunden, Tobias Mauritius Fink, Kai Frederic Engelmann, Matthias L&ouml;ffler und Stephan Rubach. Sie gr&uuml;ndeten die Memoria Myrana und hielten das Interesse am G&uuml;ldenland aufrecht. Schaut man heute zur&uuml;ck, m&ouml;chte man meinen, ohne sie &ndash; ohne das eigene Schreiben, ohne das immer wieder Herantreten an die Redaktion auf Cons, das Fordern neuer Publikationen &ndash; w&auml;re die Geschichte vielleicht eine andere geworden.&#10;Andere kamen in den Jahren seitdem hinzu, wie u. a. Ren&eacute; Littek, Christian Sa&szlig;enscheidt, Jochen Willmann, Kirsten Schwabe und auch ich.&#10;&#10;Die Helden der ersten Stunde, sind leider schon l&auml;nger nicht mehr dabei, ebenso wenig, wie die meisten Autoren der fr&uuml;hen Publikationen. Die allgemeinen Entwicklungen und Umw&auml;lzungen im derischen Kosmos und dem Setting selber haben ihre Spuren eben auch bei Myranor hinterlassen. Heute schreiben ein bis zwei Dutzend Menschen f&uuml;r den Uhrwerk Verlag an Myranor. &Uuml;ber 80 Publikationen, Artikel und Produkte sind in den bisherigen Jahren entstanden.&#10;Mit Beginn der &bdquo;Schulzeit&ldquo; kam das Kleine in neue Obhut und wurde dann dem netten Onkel Pat in Pflege gegeben, der sich auch heute noch um das mittlerweile zum Teenager gewordenen Kind k&uuml;mmert. Ihm zur Seite stehen inzwischen einige derjenigen, die ihre ersten Erfahrungen mit Myranor im Rahmen des Fanzines machen durften. Auch dieses hat nun zehn Jahre &uuml;berlebt und sich damit in die Senioren-Reihe von Fanzines hineingeschrieben. Beide Ereignisse, Jubil&auml;en beruhen auf der gleichen Grundlage: dem Engagement und der Treue von Fans. Das war der Antrieb Myranor auch gegen Fanpros M&uuml;digkeit zu unterst&uuml;tzen und der Anlass f&uuml;r Patric G&ouml;tz Myranor zu &uuml;bernehmen und weiterzuf&uuml;hren.&#10;Und deshalb ist diese Sonderausgabe auch keine dicke Werbet&uuml;te mit Geschichten &uuml;ber &bdquo;fr&uuml;her war alles besser&ldquo;, &bdquo;Was ihr schon immer &uuml;ber Myranor wissen wolltet, &hellip;&ldquo; oder einer Klappentext-Sammlung aller Publikationen.

169764,Phantasmaburbia,N/A,"The general approach I've observed in role-playing game design is to use the classic RPG structure as a starting point; a framework that's tried and true, for the designer to wrap a story around. And that's a perfectly valid approach! But I think it also makes for a spread of RPGs today that are all just a bit too similiar. I wanted to make an RPG that was a game designer's game first. That's why this is a game that has a lot more gameplay than fluff.&#10;&#10;For fans of RPGs, many elements might individually come as a shock--there's no NPCs, no shops, and just one town in the whole game. You gain levels in a way such that you're never forced to grind, and the battles themselves are made to go quickly and succinctly (this game doesn't waste your time). The decisions you make over the course of the game have little effect on the story, but have ramifications for your characters' abilities and what dungeons you play. The puzzles are based on spatial manipulation, and require logical thinking beyond memorization or basic lock-and-key archetypes. While I still clung onto some of the superficial bits of old RPGs that I loved like combat menus and inventories, I also worked at every turn to personalize those things or optimize them to make something that's both classic and new. In playing, all of these ""weird"" pieces fit together very well.&#10;&#10;But morseo, this is a game for those who ""aren't really into RPGS (anymore).""

163562,"The Good, The Bad & The Funny",2014,"The Good, The Bad & The Funny is an Apples-style party card game for a bunch of people. Players make compound words or phrases from a set of word cards to satisfy a mission. The dealer decides which of the submissions is Good, which is Bad, and which is Funny, and rewards the players appropriately (3, -2 and 5 points respectively). The first to 21 (or -10) wins.&#10;&#10;There are three main differences between The Good, The Bad & The Funny and other Apples-style games:&#10;&#10;The three main differences are:&#10;&#10;1. Scoring. Apples games with strangers can be aggravating - will they choose the funny card or the clever one? Or the realistic one? Or just choose something terrible.&#10;&#10;The dealer always has to choose The Good, The Bad & The Funny.&#10;&#10;The Good is the best representation of the mission card. It&rsquo;s worth three points because, while good, it&rsquo;s boring and obvious. And you probably had the perfect card, so whatever.&#10;&#10;The Bad is the worst submission that round. It&rsquo;s worth negative two because I&rsquo;m sick of players constantly ditching cards instead of actually thinking about a good answer. You&rsquo;ll also notice that many of the players that think they are funny will end up with a lot of bad answers.&#10;&#10;The Funny gets the biggest laugh. Subjective, of course, but it&rsquo;s worth five points for entertaining the room.&#10;&#10;The first to (or above) 21 points wins, unless there is a tie, in which case play continues as normal until a single player has the highest score.&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s another small twist, which is that players can also win by scoring -10 points. This makes it a bit more fun to be chosen for that bad answer in round 1.&#10;&#10;2. Players always play two cards. This is a game about compound words and phrases. Our lives are surrounded by such combinations - you&rsquo;ll start to notice much more after reading this sentence. Creating compound words and phrases is a wonderful challenge - it forces players to think about the many ways that a word can be interpreted and manipulated by another word. And the essence of this game is a carefully created wordlist that is composed of the most commonly occurring bits from compound words and phrases in the English language, almost all of which are nouns.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of key benefits to this approach. Most answers are not reliant on a shared understanding of pop. Many other Apples games assume a certain level of 21st Century culture familiarity while the word cards from The Good, The Bad & The Funny are timeless (the mission cards, however, do have a bit of pop-infusion). Answers won&rsquo;t get stale, as the likelihood of a one playing the same combination twice within a play session or many, many play sessions is infinitely low. Even playing the same word card won&rsquo;t have the same negative effect as in other games because it is about how two cards react together, not simply a funny reference. Even if the same two cards are played together, the order can be changed to dramatically alter the meaning.&#10;&#10;The game is very replayable without the need for many, many expansions.&#10;&#10;3. At any given time, three mission cards are face up. Dealers get to choose which mission they want to judge, which allows for another layer of strategy. Players can hold onto cards that match future possible missions (don&rsquo;t you hate throwing out the perfect card right before getting the matching mission?).&#10;&#10;",4,15,15,15,6.5,0,1,[],"['Card Game', 'Party Game', 'Print & Play']"

If the result is 8+ then you succeed. We try and keep as much information on the character sheet as possible so you don&rsquo;t have to constantly refer to the rule book.&#10;&#10;All of Time and Space&#10;&#10;All weapons and armour are described in terms of their relative weights, materials and design. Where and when they are made doesn&rsquo;t really matter. A rapier is a light weapon so it is going to do 1d6 of damage, a blaster rifle is a bigger beast and does 2d6. A tripod mounted machine gun deals out 3d6. The same principles apply to armours, the idea of light through to heavy. The best high tech armour of course performs a lot better than medieval platemail even if they are both &lsquo;heavy&rsquo;.&#10;&#10;With 3Deep you can just as easily play a space opera set following a homer-esque odyssey, a teenage scuby gang battling vampires or one of Arthurs knights searching for Morgana. The rules can handle all of these settings with equal easy.&#10;&#10;Episodic&#10;&#10;Episodic role play implies some kind of regular reset between adventures or sets of adventures. Wounds heal in hours and days, not weeks and months. 3Deep puts little emphasis on equipment lists. You rarely see characters in TV series carting huge backpacks full of equipment around with them. The plot tends to provide what is required whether it is a gadget from the bat cave or a closet full of crossbows and wooden stakes. 3Deep is also played in &lsquo;scenes&rsquo; so it is perfectly acceptable to fast forward from one location to the next without having to role play 60 days at sea or taking the metro across town. If it adds nothing to the story then those scenes end up on the cutting room floor.&#10;&#10;Story Arc Roleplaying&#10;&#10;Adventures or episodes do not have to be totally discrete, there should be a thread that runs through them, the dastardly villains plot to take over the world or Morgana&rsquo;s attempts to subvert the kingdom of Camelot. Every character starts with a number of motivations as to why they are who they are and these get woven into the game. Over time they may resolve some or all of these story arcs and at the same time gain new ones.&#10;&#10;Play with a GM and Friends or Play Solo&#10;&#10;Nearly all role playing games are designed to be played with one person and the Game Master [GM] who creates the game world, creates the story hooks and plays all the other characters in the world. The other players control one character each and the game evolves through the interaction of the characters interacting with this imaginary world, the players describing their actions and saying what their character says and the GM describing the consequences of those actions and so the story moves along. 3Deep has another option built in.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

113294,Escape: The Curse of the Temple,2012,"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice.  Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you ""discover"" magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile. The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the ""Treasures"" module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the ""Curses"" module, some tiles ""curse"" players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;",1,5,10,10,6.96262,6.77363,17113,"['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Elapsed Real Time Ending', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Physical Removal', 'Push Your Luck', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Real-Time', 'Roll / Spin and Move', 'Solo / Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement']","['Action / Dexterity', 'Adventure', 'Dice', 'Electronic', 'Exploration', 'Real-time']"

297030,Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun,2020,"Four millennia ago on the eastern bank of the Nile river was laid the foundation of the Temple of Amun-Ra. Over the course of two thousand years, the temple complex was gradually expanded and became widely known as ""The Most Select of Places"" (Ipet-Isut), boasting the largest religious building in the world. Today, the site is known as Karnak, located at Luxor in modern-day Egypt.&#10;&#10;Join ancient Pharaohs in creating and growing one of the most impressive sites the world has seen, honoring the Egyptian gods Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. You must carefully manage the balance of your actions, preparing for the reckoning by the goddess Maat.&#10;&#10;The game board in Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun is divided into six sections, each associated with an Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth, and Osiris. In the center stands an impressive obelisk (Tekhenu) that casts its shadow onto different parts of the board. As a result, the area around the obelisk is divided into sunny, shaded, and dark sections, depending on how the obelisk casts its shadow at that particular moment. As the game progresses, the sun's rotation alters which sections are sunny, shaded, or dark.&#10;&#10;The game takes place over multiple rounds. Each round, players draft dice and perform actions associated with the value of the die and the section from which the die was drafted. Dice come in five colors, and each die is considered Pure, Tainted, or Forbidden depending on the color of the die and the position of the obelisk's shadow. While you may never draft Forbidden dice, you are free to draft any other die, whether Pure or Tainted.&#10;&#10;As you draft the dice, you must consider not only the general availability of dice &mdash; if no dice are available in a given section, then you cannot readily perform the action associated with that section &mdash; but also which value die to draft. You must also consider the purity of the dice to draft, as you must balance your Pure and Tainted actions if you want to have a more favorable position in turn order.&#10;&#10;When you draft a die, you can perform an action depending on the section you took the die from. Each of the actions corresponds to a different Egyptian god: Horus, Ra, Hathor, Bastet, Thoth and Osiris. Instead of a god action, you can choose to produce, generating resources based on the color and value of the die, but beware of producing in excess of your production capacity, as this is Greed and adds Taint to your balance!&#10;&#10;Two scoring phases occur during the game, during which players earn victory points based on the workshops, quarries, buildings, statues and pillars they have built, as well as the happiness of their people and production capacity of their resources. However, players must also keep a healthy amount of resources around to sustain their population or they suffer negative consequences.&#10;&#10;",1,4,60,120,7.70328,7.09187,5942,"['Action Drafting', 'Income', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Turn Order: Stat-Based', 'Variable Set-up']","['Ancient', 'Dice', 'Mythology']"

The aim is for each player or soul to gather sufficient Heavenly Credits to be assured of Salvation and to avoid Damnation.&#10;&#10;One difference from Monopoly is that a player can win immediately by landing on the Eternal Salvation space with adequate credit or be eliminated by landing on the Eternal Damnation space without enough.&#10;&#10;Rather than building houses and hotels on the green properties, one can employ priests, canons, bishops, archbishops and saints on a mission to the satanic intelligentsia.

276889,Arcane Guardian,2019,"Arcane Guardian is a quick, fun solo dungeon crawler card game of tactics, scarce resource management, and luck. Ancient powers have risen and are threatening humanity once more. It is you, the Arcane Mage who must face them. You have to weaken them before they swarm the realm of the living. To do so, you have to confront all the terrors crawling deep below the surface. The goal of the game is simple: escape the dungeon. Will you live to see the daylight?&#10;&#10;Arcane Guardian is lightweight and highly enjoyable from the very first play with enough depth to keep you entertained. You control a mage who wanders in an enchanted dungeon, opens treasure chests, fights monsters and drinks magical potions. You have to defeat numerous elementals and undead. Try to save as much Mana as possible, for if you run out of it, you cannot even emit light from your staff and are left in the dark. Your options are limited, while the dangers are many. In Arcane Guardian, every decision matters!&#10;&#10;Arcane Guardian is a Print and Play card game. The deck contains 60 cards, and there are an additional 21 cards. One game takes about 10 minutes. The game is made up of steps that are to be carried out in a set order. In the beginning, you have three ways to go. You select a deck and interact with the upper card. If the chosen card was not revealed, then you must reveal it and instantly interact with it. You may collect the card or discard it into the discard pile. After an interaction&rsquo;s end, you have to reveal all cards that are unrevealed (face down) on top of a deck except on the one that you interacted with. If your health goes below 1, and you cannot heal than the game is over and you lose. You should always consider whether to fight an enemy and lose health, or cast spells and spend your mana. You may suffer several terrible curses that weaken you, but you can even their effects out with masks, or create powerful and interesting combinations of different positive and negative magical effects. Of course, luck has an impact on your gameplay, you have to roll a die when you open treasure chests and when you interact with traps.&#10;&#10;You play until you find an ending card among the bottom six cards of a deck. If you successfully interact with it, then you win the game and escape the dungeon.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the designer&#10;&#10;",1,1,5,15,5.67778,0,9,['Dice Rolling'],"['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Print & Play']"

Les connaisseurs remarqueront que nous avons rajout&eacute; deux r&egrave;gles optionnelles : le jet de sauvegarde unique et la classe d'armure ascendante.&#10;&#10;Pourquoi ne pas avoir fait une VF officielle de Labyrinth Lord ?&#10;Tout simplement parce que les n&eacute;gociations avec Daniel Proctor au sujet de la licence Labyrinth Lord n'ont pas abouti. L'essentiel de Labyrinth Lord (le texte et les cartes) est sous Licence Ludique Libre, mais pas la marque ""Labyrinth Lord"" et la mise en page : c'est pourquoi nous avons d&ucirc; adopter une nouvelle mise en page et trouver un nouveau nom pour cette traduction. &#10;&#10;&#10;Translation:You are an incurable nostalgic that keeps their relic like the precious ""red box"", a young gamer curious to know what the elders played, or just someone who wants a simple but complete medieval fantasy role playing games? Portes, Monstres & Tr&eacute;sors (Doors, Monsters & Treasures) is for you!&#10; This free and complete game published as a PDF is a translation and adaptation of the Open Gaming Licensed Labyrinth Lord, written by Daniel Proctor and published by Goblinoid Games. As a model, PMT emulates the mechanisms of the B/X version of D&D (the one published in 1981). Connoisseurs will notice that we have added two optional rules: the unique saving throw and increasing armor class.&#10;&#10;Why not make an official French version of Labyrinth Lord?&#10;Just because negotiations with Daniel Proctor on the Labyrinth Lord license have failed. While most of Labyrinth Lord (text and maps) is Open Gaming Licensed, the brand ""Labyrinth Lord"" and the layout are not, which is why we have adopted a new layout and found a new name for this version.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

18061,Chennault's First Fight,2005,"Publisher's blurb:&#10;&#10;As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.&#10;&#10;Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.&#10;&#10;Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.&#10;&#10;Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a ""battle board"" that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.&#10;&#10;Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.&#10;&#10;Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather. Plenty of carnage and mayhem!&#10;&#10;",2,2,300,300,6.63258,5.5251,55,"['Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation']","['Wargame', 'World War II']"

""It is a terrible thing"", he answers, ""Every night, Birdmen fly from the hills to the north and wreak this damage. Even worse, they try to take one of our men away with them. We have lost two good men. I don't know if we will ever see them again.""&#10;&#10;Vine, the leader of the Hill Men, appears from down the street, having heard the conversation.

188691,Bridges to Albion,0,"553 years in the future, seven colonies have been established on seven different planets throughout the galaxy. United Earth is stretched thin and has lost significant diplomatic and economic control over the 89 years since the first colony was established. Thanks to recent technological advances, a new planet, Albion, has suddenly become accessible through the construction of a series of space bridges. With this new access, United Earth has issued the Albion Initiative, which rewards the first pioneer that can successfully reach Albion by purchasing, constructing, and traversing four space bridges from their home planet. Once a player reaches Albion, they win the game.&#10;&#10;In order to earn sufficient in-game capital to purchase the necessary bridges, players control a spaceship that they will use to accumulate wealth and to strike fear into the hearts of their fellow gamers. Players can complete a series of missions, buy and sell commodities on the intergalactic commodities market, and engage other players in combat in order to pilfer their stores.&#10;&#10;Each turn taken consists of three parts: Tile Placement, Movement & Transactions, and Refueling.&#10;&#10;Tile Placement: At the beginning of each turn, players must draw one Navigation Tile and place it in a space that connects it to that player&rsquo;s game piece via the lanes on existent pieces. Through the placement of the Navigation tiles, the game board takes shape as game play progresses. Also, this means that no two play-throughs will utilize the same game board.&#10;&#10;Movement: After the tile is placed, players can then move their ship onto spaces that are connected to their game piece. In Bridges to Albion, players can only move as many spaces as they have fuel to reach. Each fuel cell displayed on their Ship&rsquo;s Console can be used to move one space. Each ship comes equipped with room for three fuel cells (an amount that can be upgraded eventually).&#10;&#10;Missions:&#10;Each player starts the game with three mission cards. These missions can be completed at the player&rsquo;s discretion. Once a mission is completed and the corresponding reward is received, a player can choose to draw another mission card. A maximum of three mission cards per player is allowed. Mission rewards increase with each mission completed, so completing more missions is more lucrative. However, when a player is prepared to traverse their Bridges, any incomplete missions will incur a 500c fine for each Mission Card that the player retains. Mission Cards may not be sold, but players are allowed to conduct one-for-one trades between themselves throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Combat:&#10;Any time during the game that two ships attempt to inhabit the same space on the board, a combat event is initiated. In a&#10;combat event, each player rolls one die. The player with the highest die roll wins, and the loser then must pay the winner the amount indicated on the pricing list. Ties are awarded to the non-attacking player. Battle losses are based on the number of missions the losing player has competed, and the more missions a player completes, the more they stand to lose in a fight.&#10;Each ship&rsquo;s weapons systems can be upgraded, allowing the player to roll more than one die in a combat event. The first&#10;weapons upgrade allows the player to roll two dice, and the second upgrade allows them to roll three. The sum of all&#10;applicable dice rolled is compared to the foe&rsquo;s total sum.&#10;It is possible for players to negotiate prior to a combat event being initiated in order to avoid the potential damage.&#10;&#10;Transactions: Once a player arrives to a planet, they are free to conduct any business that they so choose. The Intergalactic&#10;Commodities Market provides an opportunity to buy commodities on one planet and then sell those same commodities on&#10;another planet for a profit. Each ship has a limit of 5 commodities, an amount that can also be upgraded. Ship upgrades can be purchased either on planets or in space.&#10;&#10;Refueling: When a player has conducted all of their business, and is finished with their turn, they can then replenish their&#10;fuel supply. Players are not required to purchase any fuel cells if they choose not to, but once they do (or decline to), their turn is then concluded.&#10;&#10;Bridges:&#10;In order to reach Albion, players must construct and traverse four Space Bridges beginning at their home planet. Once&#10;purchased, players may place them in the outlined tiles. If a Navigation Tile has not been placed in a space, the Bridge may not be constructed over that space. Once (and not before) a player has built all four of their Space Bridges, other players have the opportunity to attack and destroy them. Once the player reaches Albion, they have won the game.&#10;&#10;",2,6,90,180,8.6,0,5,"['Action Queue', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Network and Route Building', 'Stock Holding', 'Trading']","['Economic', 'Exploration', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration']"

This money can be used to steal an animal from the opponent or get rid of all -1 point markers. The first player to have all different types of stalls scores bonus points.&#10;&#10;The end of the game is triggered after the sixth in-game scoring or when the ""last round"" card is revealed.

107823,Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality,N/A,"Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality is the 1990 sequel to the classic DOS platform game, The Adventures of Captain Comic. The game was created by the same author as the original, Michael Denio, working at Color Dreams and was published by ComputerEasy.&#10;&#10;The game was not as successful as its predecessor, despite containing numerous improvements and new features:&#10;&#10;Save/continue-game feature&#10;    Hundreds of objects to discover&#10;    Multiple hidden rooms and bonus objects&#10;    Four-way scrolling playfield with more color and graphics&#10;    Many new tools for Comic to use&#10;    Non-player characters to interact with&#10;    A much more involved storyline&#10;    The ability to swim, fly, ride a mine car and a sled&#10;    The game is also reportedly three times the size of the original&#10;&#10;Unlike the original (which was shareware), the game was sold commercially, which explains its lesser popularity. However, more recently it has been made available free.&#10;&#10;Captain Comic II is a platform game and like its predecessor has the concepts of shield points (health), lives, a score, items, enemies, zones and objectives.&#10;&#10;The primary health indicator is the shield. Once the shield points are exhausted by coming into contact with enemy units and then he is struck again (or if he is hit for more damage than his remaining shields), Comic loses a life. Additionally, if Comic falls off the bottom of a screen a life is lost. If Comic finds a bonus shield it will restore the points to maximum, or add the shield to his inventory for later use if already at full. The game is over when Comic loses all of his lives (or completes the main objective of the game).&#10;&#10;Bonus items can generally be found in strategic locations or inside boxes or crates that need to be opened up or destroyed by use of the pick-axe tool (one of the first goals of the game should therefore be to obtain the pick-axe). Items range from gems (points), shields (health), to tools that can be used for other purposes. A notable addition is the magic wand which can turn some useless items into useful items, ranging from powerups to keys. Generally, items also add to the game score when collected. One new feature in this version of the game is the ability to change ""active"" it (perhaps a requirement since there are now many more items to collect and use). For example, the primary item in use is the firing weapon, but when it is time to use the pick-axe tool (or key, or screwdriver, etc), Comic can select that item from his inventory.&#10;&#10;Comic must also avoid or destroy various enemies in the game, primarily by use of his firepower which he obtains by collecting Blastola Cola (again, one of the first goals early in the game should be to acquire this item). Enemies range from simple units on pre-set paths to more difficult combatants that follow Comic or seek him out directly. Some enemies move faster than others, and most are restricted to their domain (fish enemies in water, for example). All enemies have the same general property in that when they come in contact with Comic they are destroyed, but reduce his shield points accordingly (from one to four shield points depending on the enemy, as opposed to two regardless of type in Captain Comic). Destroying enemy units by shooting them also increases the game score (100 to 400 points, depending on how many shield points would normally be deducted - note that some enemies cannot be destroyed by shooting them).&#10;&#10;The game is divided into major areas, each with smaller zones. Passing from one zone or area into another marks a safe point (although this version of the game also has a save-game feature). Typically areas are identified by the presence of doorways, which require the correct key (in the previous Episode one key opened all doors; in this Episode there are multiple keys denoted by color or design).&#10;&#10;Comic can complete the main objective in the game, by successfully navigating areas and obtaining items (particularly tools) in what can be viewed as smaller objectives. For example, Comic must find the local leader to get the storyline, but also direction on obtaining the 'Temple Key' as a first objective. But there is also the side effect of learning where to acquire the pick-axe (from the guys working on the Escape Pods). As Comic works his way through the stages of the game, he collects more and better items to help with the increasingly difficult areas (particularly with regard to the enemies he must face).&#10;&#10;Source: Wikipedia, ""Captain Comic II: Fractured Reality"", available under the CC-BY-SA License.&#10;&#10;",1,1,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

246110,Gentry,2018,"From publisher blurb:&#10;&#10;Better than the Rest!&#10;&#10;Intrigue is a staple of the fantasy genre, and many players and GMs are drawn to the idea of a grand campaign of political intrigue, in which the players face the dangers of scheming politicians, backstabbing assassins, high-society soirees, and similar trials, instead of the usual drudging through moldy old dungeons, killing things and taking their stuff. A proper political drama or heist adventure can be hard to run and even harder to write, but perhaps the hardest is for players to get in the appropriate mindset, and deal with their problems with finesse, rather than a blunt weapon. One thing that can help players get in the mood&mdash;and get themselves an edge&mdash;when it comes to intrigue is having an archetype that kits their preferred class out a bit more for the type of adventure they&rsquo;ll be playing. Each installment of Weekly Wonders: Archetypes of Intrigue presents six new archetypes tied to a particular role common in intrigue adventures.&#10;&#10;For this book, we focus on archetypes of gentry and nobility. No matter the setting, even in those without an official nobility or aristocracy, the rich and the powerful always set themselves apart, always delight the lesser folk with their extravagant balls and sordid soirees, and usually, they are the ones whose plots and schemes are what sets plots of intrigue in motion. Each of the archetypes in this book focus on the ability to manipulate and influence others, social and physical grace that set aristocrats apart from others, and the power of wealth. This book includes the following archetypes:&#10;&#10;    The royal bloodline, a bloodrager bloodline for scions of royal lineages, granting the bloodrager a natural grace and a commanding presence.&#10;    The order of the coin, a cavalier order exclusive to the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, who is at home in verbal duels as those of steel, and draws strength directly from his wealth.&#10;    The doge spirit, a medium spirit that is the epitome of social grace and cunning manipulations, granting the power to influence and outmaneuver foes.&#10;    The communication discipline, for psychics, which allows them to empathically read the hearts of others, and gain greater power over charmed creatures.&#10;    The genteel explorer, a ranger archetype with a passion for safari, whose tales of adventure are the life of any party.&#10;    The grace spirit, a shaman spirit that bestows social grace and charm upon those who commune with it.&#10;&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

It is set in the small town of Br&ouml;ckel (on the travel and trading route between Altdorf and Middenheim) and the nearby forest, but it can easily be relocated to almost any other place. The town has a small,&#10;bedraggled Shallyan hospice, but sits on a trade route and is hosting an annual feast for the merchants who are vital for Br&ouml;ckel's (rather modest) prosperity.&#10;&#10;An ill noble, Ferdinand von Ziegelstein, asks the PCs to bring an old friend who's a physician.

At Austerlitz he met and soundly defeated the combined armies of Russia and Austria.&#10;&#10;Designer's Notes&#10;&#10;There is no comparison between Austerlitz and other wargames. Austerlitz is the first computer wargame to begin to utilize the computer's capabilities on a Grand Tactical scale, unlike those weak, slow, unrealistic board game clones. The Artificial Intelligence which drives the computer player is broken into three levels. On the Grand Tactical or highest level, the computer analyzes the battle to determine broad concepts: where to attack, who to send and when to retreat, or launch an all out attack.&#10;&#10;Once this is decided, another module handles the coordination of the maneuver elements (divisions, Corps, columns). This was, by far, the most difficult element in the design. From this module, targets for each Corps are selected which are most likely to bring about the success of the Grand Tactical plan.&#10;&#10;With these targets, the tactical module takes over and gives the orders to the individual units. Here things like artillery fire, units going into line to fire or column to assault towns, and the commitment of cavalry are decided. Also, the status of the Corps is checked, and if necessary, the tactical module can override the Corps orders and give them new ones.&#10;&#10;",1,2,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

154542,Satat,0,"Introduction&#10;Satat is the most popular card game in Mauritius.

The objective is to win at least seven of the 13 tricks, or even better to win the first 7 tricks, or better still all 13 tricks.&#10;&#10;Players and Cards&#10;The game plays with four players in fixed partnerships using a standard 52-card pack. What distinguish Satat from other Whist-like trick tacking games are the fact that the 2 of heart is the highest trump card of the game and the ways trump is decided.&#10;&#10;Making Trumps&#10;The dealer shuffles, the player to dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump maker, to dealer's left, looks at these five cards and announces the trump suit. Alternatively, if unwilling to decide trumps on the basis of these first five cards, the trump maker may elect to use the last four cards to determine the trump suit.&#10;&#10;End Game and Scoring&#10;Normally the play ends when one team wins by taking seven tricks. However, if a team wins the first seven tricks (a 7-0 win) they may continue the play and try to win all the tricks (13-0 win). The winning team then gets to pass cards to the losing team in exchange for trump cards in a way similar to Sergeant Major.&#10;&#10;There is no formal system of scoring and no fixed length to the game, but the players may like to keep track of how many games each team has won or lost.&#10;&#10;Variations&#10;&#10;Trup kasiet&#10;In this ""hidden trump"" variation, instead of announcing the trump suit, the trump maker places one card of the trump suit face down. If the trump card is selected unseen from the last four, the trump maker looks at it before placing it face down.&#10;&#10;In this variation 7-0 and 13-0 wins are more frequent, but no cards are exchanged after a 7-0 or 13-0 win.&#10;&#10;",4,4,0,0,5.5,0,2,"['Team-Based Game', 'Trick-taking']",['Card Game']

293882,Taoex,2016,"Taoex is an abstract strategy game where players use mono-directional tiles to navigate a hexagonal grid to capture opponents&rsquo; tiles to create multi-directional towers for greater mobility. Using the 6-pointed compass, that control all direction of play, located in the center of the board, players take turns placing their 12 tiles (2 for each compass direction) in the optimum starting hexes. Once all the 36 starting hexes have been filled the game begins with the players taking turns advancing at least 1 tile into play per turn. Within the board there is a 6-pointed star called The Way where tiles are forced to roll the 10-sided Taoex die to charge the path a tile/tower moves across the board. Regardless of whether the roll is beneficial to the rolling player, the tile must move the roll along the Way if it can. Tiles/towers that traverse board to the far side of the board, if the tile/tower manages to line up with a starting hex, the tile/tower can wrap around the board to come out on the other side once again. An excellent tactic when hunting new directions.&#10;&#10;As players begin collecting enemy tiles, by landing on them, they form towers of up to 6 tiles tall, maximum. Anything over 6 tiles the tower&rsquo;s owner either removes enemy tiles from play or in the case of his own, liberates them and returns them to an open starting hex of the appropriate direction of the tile. The game is won by a player collecting 6 of one enemy&rsquo;s tiles into a single tower or, if 1 player captures/eliminates all opponent tiles.&#10;&#10;Taoex is a challenging and unique abstract strategy game that is very simple to learn and yet offers the players a mental workout as they master their play. Naturally, the rules that govern the game are more complex than the description written above, but it is the nuances in the rules that makes all games more interesting and Taoex offers its fair share. If you are the kind of gamer that enjoys using your mind to defeat opponents rather than just relying upon some lucky dice roll or random chance, then Taoex is a game for you.&#10;&#10;&mdash;description from the publisher&#10;&#10;",2,6,30,90,9.16667,0,6,"['Hexagon Grid', 'Relative Movement']",['Abstract Strategy']

Each successive tile added on to a given street will score more and more as the street increases in length and value.&#10;&#10;Tiles must be matched to the board by color and number as a general rule, but there are a number of ""joker"" tiles that do not conform to this.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the first player achieves 1000 (2 player), 800 (3 player) or 650 points (4 player).&#10;&#10;",2,4,15,60,8,0,1,['Tile Placement'],['City Building']

131457,Septikon: Uranium Wars,2012,"From publisher:&#10;&#10;What is it?&#10;&#10;In Septikon we have tried to re-create a retro-futuristic atmosphere which was popular in games like Fallout and BioShock. The players take role of the owners and leaders of orbital mining battle stations, which are hunting for rich uranium deposits in an asteroid belt.&#10;&#10;Since there is not enough uranium for everyone, the players have to fight with other space explorers for every asteroid. By using a rich armory of defensive and offensive measures and a loyal crew of their own clones, the player will have to survive a terrible battle and do everything to be first to put the other player out of action.&#10;&#10;This game is completely unique. Imagine a turn-based game in the Tower Defence genre, where you must not only protect your own prosperity, but also send waves of attackers in your opponent's direction!&#10;&#10;How do you play?&#10;&#10;The station is not automated, which makes it much more reliable but at the same time requires a crew for manual operation. The player rolls a die, which determines the distance that one of his obedient clones can travel to the required section, to activate a piece of equipment or a weapon which is installed there. The choice of clones and the goal will depend on the current situation and the player's long-term strategy.&#10;&#10;The station is completely autonomous. The player can mine and process resources, carry out repairs, defrost new clones to increase the size of his crew &mdash; but it's not that easy when you are being attacked by your opponent's entire battle force, and you want to teach them a lesson...&#10;&#10;The player wins when he puts the other player's station completely out of action.&#10;&#10;Why should I play Septikon?&#10;&#10;&#10;    It's original. Are you looking for something new? We can guarantee that you have never seen a game like this one!&#10;    It's well developed. Like a good brandy, our game was in development for 12 years &mdash; that's 12 years of constant testing and thousands of matches played.&#10;    It's dynamic. Sid Meier said, ""A game is a series of interesting choices."" Septikon will not overload or bore you into a stupor. Of course, the player has something to think about every turn, but he has only a limited number of optimal choices. That means that you won't spend too much time waiting your turn.&#10;    It&rsquo;s multi-faceted: Consider a whole range of strategies that all deserve to be tried out:&#10;        Burning. Burn through the opponent&rsquo;s battle station with your lasers, cutting him off his supplies, ammunition and oxygen.&#10;        Suppression. Destroy his battle sections and maintenance modules, block his shooters and stop him from recovering.&#10;        Landing. Attack your enemy with a squad of fully armored and equipped BioDrones. Let them rip through his defenses.&#10;        Exhaustion. Destroy your opponent&rsquo;s strategic resources with quick targeted attacks and sneaky diversions, and while he is trying to recover, create an invincible army.&#10;        Massacre. Focus your entire production on creating nuclear charges. Suppress the opponent&rsquo;s defenses and drown him in a nuclear fog.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;&#10;&#10;    24 clone figures (in two different colors). Each one of them will obediently carry out all your orders and activate different station modules.&#10;    160 wooden cubes, representing resources which will be needed to run the station and keep it safe: Oxygen, Metal, Rockets, BioMass, Energy, BioDrones and &mdash; obviously &mdash; Uranium;&#10;    4 nuclear Rockets for those who like it hot;&#10;    8 satellite tokens and 8 Energy Shield tokens &mdash; efficient measures for launching your own space-to-space grid;&#10;    80 damage tokens &mdash; during the space battles stations will take a lot of damage, and many sections will be competely put out of action;&#10;    1 huge game board with two stations and some space between them;&#10;    2 six-sided dice, which in this game are called Random Number Generators. A single roll at the beginning of the turn will determine the ""time period"" which the player can use this turn.&#10;    2 books &mdash; One, consisting of just 2 pages, contains the Intro Game Rules, the other, the full rules (8 pages).&#10;&#10;&#10;How did the game come to life?&#10;&#10;Igrology is one of most successful Russian board game developers. We have created 18 products, many of which are constantly being re-published. In 2011, we have sold over 100,000 copies in total in Russia.&#10;&#10;Now we are facing a new task, to bring unique ideas to the international games' market. Septikon is the first and very important step for us in that direction.&#10;&#10;Septikon was created by the Russian game designer Konstantin Seleznev and polished by 12 years of work and thousands of matches. In 2011, Igrology noticed this original game at the Moscow Games Convention ""Igroteka Avtorov"", where all other publishers did not pay a lot of attention to it due to its very unusual concept and seemingly complicated game board.&#10;&#10;The Igrology team, together with the game author, spent almost a year creating a setting, fine-tuning game rules, and polishing the design. Now, we have the pleasure of bringing it to all board game fans.&#10;&#10;During the next year we will be releasing the first expansion, as well as an iPad version of Septikon.&#10;&#10;",2,2,45,45,6.34685,5.54009,130,"['Grid Movement', 'Roll / Spin and Move']","['Print & Play', 'Science Fiction']"

For eons, the Gods joyfully played until eventually falling into a deep slumber. It was during this slumber that the children of the Gods rose and flourished in Vana'diel, extracting gold from stones, traveling through the sky, building mighty cities, and giving birth to grasslands across the world.&#10;&#10;Eventually, the children longed to join their parents, and constructed a pathway to the Divine Entrance of Paradise. Enraged by such an insolent act, the Holy Gatekeeper smote the children, and cast their cities to the bottom of the sea.&#10;&#10;Shortly thereafter, the Goddess Altana awoke, and saw the ruin that had once been Vana'diel. Filled with an emotion that the likes of a God had never felt before, sadness, Altana wept five divine tears. When the five tears fell upon the earth, they gave life to the five races of Vana'diel.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

It is uncertain if it will be even able to reach the gate equally reinforced with steel bands. It could still be set on fire by the defenders. Even if the defenders don't manage to set the ram itself on fire they could still try to torch the bridge the ram has to cross to reach the gate.

The story is told through cutscenes, scripted events, telegraph messages, and intelligence that the player finds scattered throughout the game. The game involves the main character, B.J. Blazkowicz, going to a fictional German town called Isenstadt, which serves as ""hub"" for the player throughout the game. Isenstadt is where the player can get missions from two different groups, or upgrade their weapons and powers at the Black Market.&#10;&#10;There are a total of nine weapons, six real-life ones (grenades, the MP40, the Kar98k, the MP43, the Panzerschreck, and the Flammenwerfer) and three fictional ones (the Particle Cannon, the Tesla Gun, and the Leichenfaust 44). Mounted MG42s can be found throughout the game, and each one can be used by the player.&#10;&#10;Aside from the weapons, the player also finds a medallion called the ""Thule Medallion"". With it, the player can get many abilities. The abilities are Veil Sight (the ability to see secrets, and, once upgraded, through walls), Mire (the ability to slow down time), Shield (the ability to throw up a shield that blocks, and, once upgraded, bounces back bullets), and Empower (the ability to significantly increase the damage of the player's weapons).&#10;&#10;Every time the player activates the Medallion, the player enters a dimension called the ""Veil"", which is a barrier between this dimension and the fictional ""Black Sun"" dimension, the power source the Nazis want to master. Inside the Veil, the player can see floating creatures called ""geists"". Geists can be destroyed, and destroying them releases an energy burst which can kill or stun nearby enemies. Geists are usually passive, but if the player kills one, others can become angry and attack the player in a suicidal explosion.&#10;&#10;Various items can be collected throughout the game: Gold, Intelligence, and Tomes of Power. Gold is used as currency to buy various upgrades from the Black Market. Intelligence provides some background information about the story, and is used to unlock some of the upgrades for weapons.

179535,Sea of Thieves,N/A,"Players can complete voyages offered by the game's three main trading companies: Gold Hoarders, Order of Souls, and the Merchant Alliance. In the quests offered by Gold Hoarders, players are given a treasure map or a riddle to locate a treasure chest. The voyages offered by the Order of Souls are combat challenges, in which players travel to islands specified by the quest to defeat waves of skeletons. The Merchant Alliance's missions demand players to deliver animals or cargo to certain vendors within a limited time. Three smaller factions also exist. Two of them, the Hunter's Call and the Reaper's Bones, do not offer quests. The Hunter's Call will reward players who bring them cooked fish and meat, particularly from rarer types of fish. The Reaper's Bones will pay for all kinds of treasures, and players can also give them special cursed treasures or emissary flags stolen from other ships. When players collect a treasure, they need to deliver them to the representatives of the quest-giving faction, though the one holding the chest are defenseless and may have it be taken by other players. Selling the treasure earns players gold, which can be spent on buying cosmetic items. Pets, emotes and further cosmetic items can also be purchased using real-world currency by accessing the Pirate Emporium store. Doubloons, earned through completing commendations from the Bilge Rats, the fourth trading company that distributes quests, challenges, and cosmetics added to the game via post-launch updates, can be traded for cosmetics, gold, or reputation to the other factions. The Anniversary update added Tall Tales, which are a series of structured narrative missions. Selling treasures to any of the three main trading companies, as well as Reaper's Bones or Athena's Fortune, earns the player reputation points, which unlock more complicated quests from each faction and additional purchasable cosmetics. When players reach rank 50 with any three of the 6 trading companies, they will earn the title of ""pirate legend"", which grants players new cosmetic items and access to a pirate hideout, the Tavern of Legends, as well as a special trading company called Athena's Fortune&#10;&#10;",1,1,N/A,N/A,7.77059,6.06628,17,[],[]

23995,No Peace Without Spain!: The War of the Spanish Succession 1702-1713,2011,"(from Compass games website:)&#10;&#10;In November 1700, King Carlos II of Spain died without an heir. The long-standing feud between the Bourbons and Habsburgs erupted once again as both sides pressed their claim to the throne. ""No Peace Without Spain"" is a two-player Card-Driven wargame that elegantly recreates this epic struggle using a point-to-point map and a single deck of 55 cards. Action cards are used to activate armies for movement and siege, while event cards bring historical and special events into play that can swing the tide of fortune when least expected. Each turn represents one year, each corps represents 10,000 men of all arms and each leader represents a major commander and his staff.&#10;&#10;The game features an easy and intuitive battle system that highlights a unique aspect of this war: team-based battle command, perhaps the most famous example being the extraordinary success achieved by the partnership of two of the war&rsquo;s most prominent commanders, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Bourbon cause has talented leaders as well, notably Marshals Villars, Vendome and Berwick. These and other leaders are rated for Tactical and Command capabilities and they significantly influence the course of events.&#10;&#10;The map stresses the importance of fortresses in a war that was probably the high-point of formal siege warfare. Fortresses in this era rarely held out against a besieger that had the necessary time and manpower to conduct a proper siege, and the game neatly recreates this with a simple siege table that leaves room for unusually stout defenses or quick collapses.&#10;&#10;Victory points are gained or lost by the Alliance player and game victory comes either through automatic victory or based on final VPs after the 1713 turn.&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;""No Peace Without Spain"" is a two player Card-Driven wargame depicting the ""War of the Spanish Succession"". The war was fought primarily to determine the fate of the Spanish throne and its dominions but also represented a continuing struggle for political, religious and economic dominance. One player represents the interests of the French claimant, Philip V (the Bourbons), while the other player represents the interests of the Austrian claimant, Charles III (the Alliance).&#10;&#10;Each turn is one year.

98532,Shadows Over Sol,2011,"From Introduction:&#10;&#10;Shadows Over Sol is the latest setting from the Tab Creations Collective. Conceived of late in 2009 as part an initiative to explore the boundaries of what was possible in the Saga Machine system, Shadows Over Sol is the second setting released for the game, and the first to take Saga Machine into the realm of science fiction and outer space.&#10;&#10;Space & Horror&#10;Shadows Over Sol borrows themes and elements from the horror genre, in addition to the science fiction genre, and in many ways space is the perfect setting for horror. Space is alien, isolating and quite hostile to human life. It gets characters outside of their comfort zone, separated from all the usual safety nets that they could normally fall back on in society. This isolation forces characters to take matters of survival into their own hands, even if those hands aren't an expert at the task.&#10;&#10;Using space as a set-piece for horror provides a variety of tools and features that can be used to further the mood of horror as the player characters struggle to survive: Communications could be cut off. Life support could begin to fail. Sensors could be damaged. Thrusters could be sabotaged, leaving a ship a long, long voyage home. Unexpected things could happen while a character is in hibernation. And, of course, there could be things out there.&#10;&#10;Player Characters&#10;Shadows Over Sol is a setting filled with many competing interests, shadowy organizations and secret conspiracies. All of these groups have the need for small bands of agents to covertly do their dirty work, any one of these groups might hire the player characters. Out there in space a thousand things could be happening, all unknown to the population back home &mdash; a population that wants to stay fed and comfortable in its ignorance.&#10;&#10;Shadows Over Sol by default assumes that player characters are members of one of these freelance teams, working for different organizations. This gives the game master a structure to build sessions around&mdash;missions on behalf of one of these entities &mdash; and player characters the agency in deciding which missions to take and which organizations they feel comfortable working for. Naturally, however, more dangerous missions come with greater rewards. But even the more innocuous-seeming mission could have unforeseen deadly twists lurking in the darkness of space.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

Thus the tiles making a randomized board.&#10;&#10;2) The tiles used above are the playing board and the playing pieces.&#10;&#10;3) The game uses the relationships of one tiles to another as a mechanic to manipulate luck, and unforeseen or uncontrolled  events. This also encourages ever developing tactics and interpersonal strategies (more so when later volumes are played in concert with one another).&#10;&#10;4) The box instructions gives two player mode instruction. but the game plays up to 4 players in the Volume One level. The 3 and 4 player modes of play are suggested on our web site.&#10;&#10;5) The game was designed for two primary reasons. To help keep the designer brother out of trouble and as a model of one basic form of social political behavior...Don't ask me.&#10;&#10;6) Hard rules augmented with a few soft rules. the soft rules force personal interaction and create a fog of war atmosphere...again don't ask me...it just works.&#10;&#10;7) Players on your side of play may or may not really be playing on your side.&#10;&#10;8) The game uses its art as a fog of war mechanism.&#10;&#10;9) The game has a slight learning curve; but the game is basic in  play.&#10;&#10;",0,0,0,0,4.5,0,2,"['Area Majority / Influence', 'Modular Board', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Player Powers']",['Fighting']

If two 1s are thrown, two counters are put in.  If either die displays a 6, both dice and one counter are passed to the player on the thrower's left.&#10;&#10;A player without counters cannot roll the dice, and thus merely passes them on.  (He or she is not out of the game, however, since  he or she will receive a counter if the player on the right rolls a 6.)&#10;&#10;Play continues until there is only 1 counter left outside the pot.  The player with this counter makes three consecutive rolls.  If he or she does NOT roll a 6, then he or she has won.  If, though, a 6 is rolled, the counter and the dice are passed to the player on the left, who in turns rolls three times.  And so on. The first player to roll three times without a 6 wins the game.&#10;&#10;Despite being entirely luck-based, the game is fun on account of its dramatic twists and turns and come-from-behind wins.

175004,The Dracula Dossier: Director's Handbook,2015,"Four Generations of EDOM&#10;&#10;For years, it has been a legend. Somewhere in the dusty archives of MI6 is the complete version of Bram Stoker&rsquo;s novel Dracula &mdash; the unredacted version. The full story revealed clear pointers to the sources and methods the Service used in Operation EDOM, an 1893 mission that sent a bold agent deep into the Balkans to awaken and then terminate a very dangerous asset indeed.&#10;&#10;But the termination didn&rsquo;t take. In 1940, desperate to stop Hitler&rsquo;s march through Europe, the Service reactivated EDOM, and reanimated their Transylvanian asset. Once more, they found they had bitten off more than they could chew, and in the chaos of wartime Romania they put him to sleep. Or so they thought.&#10;&#10;In 1977, MI6 discovered that they weren&rsquo;t the only players in this game. Their asset had left his own sleepers behind in Moscow and Romania &mdash; and in London &mdash; and inside MI6. The Service had to reopen EDOM, awaken Dracula again, to find his agents in their own ranks &mdash; or so they said. Perhaps that reawakening was the sleeper&rsquo;s doing, too. Perhaps the Count never slept, not as the Service thought.&#10;&#10;In 2011, looking for a terror great enough to fight terror, MI6 once more reached for EDOM. Once more, Dracula reached back. That&rsquo;s how you found the EDOM case file: the Dracula Dossier.&#10;&#10;Three Generations of Intel&#10;&#10;The edition of Dracula you found is more than complete &mdash; it&rsquo;s annotated. MI6 analysts and EDOM field men kept notes in the margins of their priceless copies of Stoker&rsquo;s work, notes from 1940, from 1977, and from 2011. Notes collated into one master case file, a file that vanished in 2011. The file you found. This is the dossier you must decipher to find the secrets of EDOM, to reveal who betrayed the 1893 operation, to discover who in MI6 still serves Count Dracula today.&#10;&#10;And then, you must follow those clues to end the story once and for all, to close EDOM forever. You must find, hunt, and kill Dracula, the king of the vampires.&#10;&#10;Your Generation of Horror&#10;&#10;The Dracula Dossier follows in the fully improvisational path of the award-winning Armitage Files campaign. Players follow up leads in the margins of Dracula Unredacted, chasing down the real characters from Stoker&rsquo;s novel, their descendants in the present, and the British agents caught in the backblast.&#10;&#10;Combine these leads and notes with pre-prepared elements such as conspiracy nodes, eerie locations, and vampiric beasts. The dossier contains over 40 supporting characters in vampiric, heroic, or in-between versions. Different versions of the real Mina Harker, Abraham van Helsing, and the other stars of Stoker&rsquo;s novel &mdash; and their modern-day successors, descendants, and survivors &mdash; can drive the story in any direction the players look.&#10;&#10;Players choose which leads to track, which scarlet trail to follow. The Director, using the clear step-by-step techniques in this book, improvises a suitably blood-soaked thriller in response to their choices. Clear advice to players and Directors on improvisation, with extensive examples and guidelines, helps you set the scene.

Motive power for the Aerotrain came in the form of a sleek Electro-Motive locomotive designated the LWT12, which was equipped with a standard EMD 567-series 1,200-horsepower diesel power plant. The Aerotrain&rsquo;s low-slung passenger coaches were based upon GM&rsquo;s standard 40-passenger intercity bus carbody, which for rail service was widened by 18 inches and mounted on a pair of axles per coach.&#10;&#10;General Motors assembled a pair of 10-car Aerotrain demonstrators in 1955. The distinctive streamliner made its debut in January 1956 when one of the demonstrators ran from Washington, D.C., to Newark, New Jersey on the Pennsylvania Railroad while the second dashed from Chicago to Detroit on the New York Central. The Pennsylvania Railroad then leased one Aerotrain and utilized it as a nine-car train in New York-Philadelphia-Pittsburgh service, while the second Aerotrain undertook a barnstorming tour that included working on U.S. railroads such as the Santa Fe and Union Pacific. A third Aerotrain locomotive was constructed for the Rock Island and the RI eventually purchased the two demonstrators as well.&#10;&#10;Created for Train Simulator by DTM, the complete Aerotrain (LWT12 locomotive, coach, and coach-observation) is authentically re-created wearing the Pennsylvania Railroad&rsquo;s famed &ldquo;Keystone&rdquo; logo, making it perfect for service on Train Simulator&rsquo;s classic Horseshoe Curve route (available separately).

Strange happenings are becoming more and more common. The street-side prophets are starting to sound a bit reasonable. The corporations smell power and have started pouring a lot of money into investigating and documenting these occurrences&mdash;that&rsquo;s where you come in.&#10;&#10;A Darkening Alley introduces the new Antiquarian playbook, a Trauma system by DYMPHNA, and several magical abilities available to players through basic advances.

These characters are then sent on heists to try and overcome defense cards in front of objectives, using their different sets of skills to bypass guards, traps and walls to get to the filthy lucre that they're after. Players not involved in the heist will, of course, try and stop the thieves in their tracks by playing Scheme cards, which represent the quirks of fate which might cause a heist to fail--unexpectedly alert guards, City Watch patrols, or the simple mistake that leads to disaster.&#10;&#10;Staging a heist alone is difficult, but working together with other players leaves you open to betrayal by your so-called allies, or gives you the chance to betray them, and take it all for yourself. Once any player has been betrayed, the game changes, and more dangerous abilities on different cards can now be played. The Assassin begins killing other characters, the Pickpocket starts stealing from players, the Fall Guy takes the blame, and the whole table becomes a little more vicious.

85666,Raptor Class Gunship,2005,"From Introduction:&#10;&#10;The Raptor Class design was created in response to a military request for a new gunship. Growing threats along the borders of several systems necessitated that this new design enter production as quickly as possible, bypassing the usual research and development (R&D) phase usually associated with new ships. Several ship builders were invited to submit designs for this new contract, titled XG-203. In the end, the Lockdyne corporation received the production contract as none of the other participants could meet the tight production and IOC (Initial Operational Capability) for the first squadron of ships. Lockdyne had been able to meet this timetable by utilizing an off-the shelf approach to many of the ship&rsquo;s systems and basing the design on the commercially successful C-477 cargo ship. The original contract called for a vessel that would incorporate the new Bruning PPC-4 Plasma Pulse Cannon in addition to the usual compliment of energy weapons and missile batteries. Lockdyne engineers realized that the new ship would essentially be &lsquo;built around&rsquo; this new weapon due to its massive size. By making modifications to the existing C-477 design they were able to meet the IOC requirement and bring the project in under budget. Changes to the C-477 design included moving the cockpit right of center to make room for the PPC-4 cannon and related equipment and the addition of &ldquo;wings&rdquo; to accommodate the experimental dual Speer XM33 burst guns which were ordered into production for this contract. The XM33 design had not finished its testing when production was ordered, and the design still had one major flaw to overcome. The weapon delivered the expected energy output, but the gun itself emitted a short surge or radiation each time it was fired. To overcome this the decision was made to mount the guns at the ends of two &ldquo;wings&rdquo; that would give the necessary distance to protect the crew from any hazards associated with the guns use. The engineers saw an opportunity with these new structures and proceeded to incorporate a new Lockdyne design for magnetic shield emitters into the wing structures. This new design proved highly effective and may be utilized in future Lockdyne ships. The first ship served as the sole prototype/test craft, and after just a month of trial runs full production proceeded on schedule. The production vessel was designated the G-203. While some minor improvements have been introduced throughout the production, no sub-designator has been issued for the design. An advanced version is rumored to be in development by the Lockdyne Corporation.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,9,0,1,[],[]

267470,Ruinations: Post-Apocalyptic Roleplaying,2018,"From Introduction:&#10;&#10;Ruinations is a post-apocalyptic roleplaying game based on the framework and tradition of old school gaming. While many modern games focus on grandiose story telling with imperishable player characters, Ruinations predominantly focuses on two key elements: ruin-running and survival.&#10;&#10;Where warriors, wizards and thieves delved into dungeons and catacombs to face certain death in the hunt for fortune, knowledge and glory, characters in this post-apocalypse venture into crumbled cities, underground bunkers, and sprawling silos to discover valuable goods, information and artifacts.&#10;&#10;Unlike many post-apocalyptic games, Ruinations is not focused on a setting littered with super-science, plasma rifles and &lsquo;gonzo&rsquo; creatures, but rather a grittier near-future as&#10;depicted in media such as The Road Warrior, The Last of Us, and Wasteland. While mutations and highly advanced technology may exist, they are not the norm and should not be treated as such. And though raiders, feral creatures and irradiated men are common enemies in the wastes, the true horrors hiding among the ruins should be singular and unique: that is not an aberration, it is the aberration.&#10;&#10;Resource management is vital. Sleep and rest are necessary. Every shot matters and some battles are best avoided. At the end of the day, chances are good someone in your party will not make it back alive.&#10;&#10;",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,0,0,[],[]

The game is over when only one player is able to move. Each game is unique as the board layout is randomized and evolves as the game goes on.&#10;&#10;Objective: To keep your opponent from moving.&#10;&#10;Setup: Each player starts with 8 pieces placed on the board as shown below.&#10;&#10;Board: The board is made up of 40 black squares overlaid with 40 green tile squares as shown above. Pieces can move across black squares, but can never land on them. Green tiles are removed from the board when a piece or stack of pieces moves off the green tile. A black square is exposed when a green tile is removed. Each black square counts as a move when passing over the square. Below are two examples of green tiles that have been removed in some opening moves.&#10;&#10;Pieces: A single piece can move one space in any direction,as long as it doesn&rsquo;t land on a black square. Pieces can land on other pieces, both their own and their opponent&rsquo;s. When one piece combines with another piece, whether it be their own, or an opponent&rsquo;s piece it gains the ability to move another space in any direction. Every piece in a stack enables the stack to move that number of spaces. For instance, if a stack has 3 pieces it can move 3 spaces as shown in the figure below. Pieces must always move in a straight line.&#10;&#10;Capturing and Releasing: When a piece is placed on top of an opponent&rsquo;s piece or stack that piece, or stack belongs to the one with their piece on top of the stack.

76414,The Hidden World,2004,"From the Game's Introduction:&#10;&#10;This game was written for the 24 hour RPG project. I heard of the project a while ago and thought it was a great way of trying out new RPG ideas. The motivation/inspiration for this particular game came out of a number of things: (1) liking Ars Magica, but getting tired of the complexity and enormous amounts of bookkeeping required by the system; (2) wondering what an Ars game would look like set in modern times, (3) the ""high die"" version of Risus: The Anything RPG, and (4) a game like The Pool that gives more power to the players. And here's the result, such as it is.  I wasn't able to do everything I wanted to; in particular, I started writing it as a ""traditional"" RPG with the assumption of only one GM - with the intention of going back and writing in an option for more player power - but then I ran out of time!

11374,Villages,1991,"Villages is one of the first ""boardgames"" ported from a computer game.  Unfortunately, that means you have to do all the bookkeeping on paper that the computer could do easily.  Most players will find it a bit tedious to constantly have to calculate and record population, crops, seed, food, weapons, etc.  However, we sometimes play it at a restaurant while waiting for the food to come - it's not a bad way to pass the time, really, when you don't have less portable games around.&#10;&#10;The game consists of a rules/events booklet, three six-sided dice, and a pad of record sheets.  The game is set in a mythical Renaissance-era kingdom, with each player playing a separate village in that kingdom.  You can trade goods with each other each turn, but can only attack others when you roll a ""1"" for an event table.&#10;&#10;To play, each player takes a record sheet (you may need more than one per person, depending on how long the game lasts) and a pencil.  Determine first player, and write down your starting village: 5 each of people, gold, land, food, and seed.  The seed can go into either the ground as crops or storage - you should have some of each for safety.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she rolls the three dice.  The red die tells you which table to look under: Attacks, Catastrophes, Good Times, Mixed Events, All Players Involved, or More Mixed Events.  The green (or yellow in some sets) die is then the ""tens"" digit, and the white die the ""ones"" digit.  So a roll of 5, 4, 1 means you look at event #41 on table 5.  (That's a bad one, a plague, but it's bad for everybody ...)&#10;&#10;Once a player has resolved an event, ALL players Harvest crops, make weapons, get people, eat food, barter with other players or the King, store food and seed, plant seed - record this on your sheet with a pencil.  You assign your people to weapon making or harvesting - they can't do both in the same turn.  Then the next player takes their turn at the event table, after which ALL players repeat the harvest, weapons, food, seed, etc.  This is the part that drives some people crazy - there's a LOT of record keeping.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player reaches either 20 land units, 200 gold, or reaches a population of 35 people.
